CRANKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Cranks are appliances to turn things round.</p>

<p>A Crank that revolves only half way will not
always accomplish much of a change, and in
many cases would only aggravate the situation.
Were it not for Cranks nearly all mechanical
appliances would be motionless.</p>

<p>Men’s thoughts and opinions would all be the
same, without some such device to get them out
of the old notions, grooves and ruts in which
they long have indulged and plodded. The world
has known Cranks ever since our first parents
adopted the wearing of fig leaves, and Noah took
up ship building on the weather bureau suggesting
cloudy weather and showers in Eastern
Turkey. Moses was a Crank when he forbid
the eating of pork, salt water eels, turkey buzzards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
owls and all other unclean birds, fish or
animals of any kind, but there is no doubt that
these commands were none of his mistakes.</p>

<p>Sacred writ gives a plenty of such characters,
but, by skipping to times more recent, we find
such Cranks as Copernicus, Galileo, Columbus,
Newton, Franklin, and, during the last century,
the Crank family has greatly increased with
Daguerre, Watt, Howe, Edison, Marconi and
Tesla and scores of others, who, in some of the
earlier times, would have been hung or burned
as wizards and sorcerers.</p>

<p>Political, historical and religious Cranks have
sprung up, turning over and upsetting many old-fogey
and absurd notions and beliefs of the past.</p>

<p>In former times Cranks were the subject of
ridicule and persecution for trying to inject some
new ideas into the public mind. History is profuse
with abuses of some of the best thoughts
and discoveries that have come to the human
race.</p>

<p>Supposing Copernicus had never advanced and
enforced a conclusion that the Earth was round
and revolved on its axis, such motion causing
the apparent rising and setting of the Sun. Only
for this we might to this day believe in the story
of Joshua’s command over the sun and moon, and
associate believers with Parson Jasper that “De<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
sun do move.” It is pleasant to realize that we
are living in a time when new thoughts do not
frighten people, and we are not scared at what
we cannot understand, even if it does not harmonize
with antiquated ideas purporting to be
4,000 to 6,000 years old.</p>

<p>The humble and obscure individual who presumes
to offer the few succeeding pages of crude
ideas may be classed among pigmy Cranks, but,
nevertheless, feels impelled to sow a little
thoughtful seed on a subject that, to his knowledge,
has never been discussed; and with a hope
that such seed may some of it fall in good ground,
and spring up a crop of criticism that may ultimate
in some better mind taking it up and demonstrate
with the success that the writer believes it
merits.</p>

<p>To prove that the Earth was round required a
long time and a serious amount of persecution.
Now, to assume that it is hollow, may require
more time than the brief discussion in this small
book. Yet it is hoped the ideas here may take
root in the enlightenment of the present day and
start a growth productive of good fruit in the
future. In order to discuss this question involves
a task that in the outset may look discouraging,
as follows:</p>

<p>The ax must be laid at the root of many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
favorite and long accepted beliefs laid down by
scientific authorities to explain the principal phenomena
of disturbances on and in the Mother
Earth, and to overthrow nearly all accepted
theories on the following subjects:</p>

<p>The assumption that the Earth is intensely hot
or in a molten state in its interior;</p>

<p>The presumption that it is a solid ball;</p>

<p>The supposition that there is an actual pole;</p>

<p>That hills and mountains are always results of
volcanoes;</p>

<p>That volcanoes are a prime or natural existence;</p>

<p>That living springs and lakes are results of
surface influence;</p>

<p>The theories of the Gulf Stream;</p>

<p>Icebergs and the Ice belt, their formation;</p>

<p>Glaciers, how formed;</p>

<p>Equable condition of the Mediterranean Sea;</p>

<p>And the Law of Attraction of Gravitation,</p>

<p>Or that the Sun is a mass of heat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II.<br />


FIRE AND WATER.</h2>
</div>

<p>The two elements of fire and water are evidently
the source of all created things.</p>

<p>It is the purpose in this plain and homely
dissertation to review and criticise some theories
set forth by scientists, and to introduce some new
ones more acceptable to the mind of the writer,
and to be submitted to observing minds to decide
upon their merit.</p>

<p>It is a generally believed assertion that the
Earth has been a molten mass at or near its
origin, except from the rather doubtful story of
creation related in first chapter of Genesis, where
it appears that the spirit of God moved upon the
face of the waters. When or how they were
created, the story fails to relate. But, admitting
the waters to prevail to such an extent as to incline
God’s spirit for a voyage thereon, would
make the idea of a molten Earth rather improbable.</p>

<p>The Earth is said to be undergoing a cooling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
process for the past thousands of years, but at
some remote time in the past it was covered with
ice and traversed by glaciers.</p>

<p>There are various explanations of the phenomena
of icebergs, glaciers, volcanoes, the Gulf
Stream, and why the Mediterranean Sea does not
fill up or change its conditions through the thousands
of years known to history. The philosophy
of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, increase of
heat in digging deep in the earth, artesian wells,
springs and lakes, all have various solutions for
being as they are, but this discussion proposes
to throw into the waste-basket nearly all of the
accepted conclusions on the subject, and, in order
to go to an extreme limit of Crankism, will dispute
the law of Attraction of Gravitation. To
dispute the long accepted conclusions on most of
these topics would be presumptuous without an
effort to give good and sufficient reason for such
skepticism.</p>

<p>The first element to consider will be fire, or
heat, without which, it seems safe to assert, nothing
can be produced from the Earth, or by the
devices of man. To draw a base line to work
from, we will begin at the polar center of the
Earth’s motion. The Earth, unlike any other object
that perpetually revolves that we see or
know of, does not have a shaft, or axle, or anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to create friction, and, therefore, heat.
There is but one word in the English language
that tells what will produce heat; that is friction,
which may claim motion for its parentage. Now,
this proposition is offered for a starting point.
All heat is produced by friction, in the absence
of which there can be no heat. This claim made,
and presumably well established, how can there
be any central heat of the Earth, revolving on
nothing but an imaginary center? Will any
scientist explain at what point heat begins to
generate? It would appear as difficult as to
accurately fix the point where moral responsibility
commences in a child, or just when the
wheel of time will cease to revolve. At whatever
point heat begins, is it supposable that it
works internally or outward? Any observing
mind can give but one answer.</p>

<p>It is claimed, to prove the molten condition of
the Earth’s interior, that the various borings for
artesian wells and diggings in mines show a
uniform increase of heat as greater depths are
attained. All these ratios of increase differ somewhat
in different localities, but not enough to
have ever banished the idea that at a few thousand
feet of depth everything would be a liquid
mass. This idea ought to be absurd enough to
make a brazen image smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Let us consider what these explorations into
the bowels of the Earth amount to. The deepest
holes bored or dug are, without exception, less
than a mile deep. Admitting a mile, that is
1-4000 of the distance toward the center.
Imagine a puncture on an orange, or on a ball
eight inches in diameter being four inches to
the center. Is there any man living could see
a hole as small in proportion to its size to 1-4000
of one-half of its diameter? How insignificant
such a test. Reasons for this delusion will be
given later on, under treatment of Volcanoes.</p>

<p>Again, the Earth’s surface is covered with at
least four-fifths water at depths ranging from
one to five miles, including the millions of
springs, lakes and rivers on land, to say nothing
of the inexhaustible quantities of water encountered
in the aforesaid boring and mining operations.</p>

<p>The deepest explorations in mines are the salt
mines of Poland, the Calumet and Hecla copper
mines and Comstock Lode. These have all been
on trail of some mineral deposit formed by some
remote work of Nature in the undefinable past,
when volcanic or other influences in Nature’s
laboratory left their deposit. These are the only
places that man has explored, only insignificant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
depths, and formed extravagant conclusions of
the rest of the way.</p>

<p>But let us go back to the oceans, with their
great depths and extended areas, and what do
we find? It is this: Whether on the Equator
or on the coasts of Greenland, in the tropics or
frigid latitudes the same, that at the deepest sea
soundings the temperature is near or below the
freezing point, being literally liquid ice. These
temperatures are at depths of five times as deep
as anybody has bored or dug, and cover four-fifths
of the Earth’s surface, and, instead of being
hot, or even warm, are extremely cold.</p>

<p>If the internal heat is as great as is claimed, it
ought to be enough to set every drop of water
in the oceans into a boiling condition inside of
fifteen minutes, but there does not seem to be
heat enough to warm the bottom of the kettle.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the earth originated in a
nebulous form, or an aggregation of small starry
bodies, or something else which nobody has as
yet explained clearly.</p>

<p>It is evident that our Earth has come into its
present form through a vast amount of time and
changes, and is made up largely of liquids and
plastic substances, which must have had an existence
in its origin. There is little doubt but that
all its composition has been revolving through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
space in some form for countless millions of
years with its mixtures of liquid, gaseous and
solid constituents.</p>

<p>It does not need a long argument to demonstrate
that bodies in such revolutions as the earth
is making have a tendency, by centrifugal force,
to throw the heavier elements to the outside, and
as this seems to be a universal law in all scientific
experiments by man, it seems reasonable to
suppose the earth’s centrifugal forces are no exception
in their results. Such being the case,
leads at once to the supposition and probability
that the Earth is a hollow globe, and not a solid
mass, with points of actual poles at each end
that can be explored.</p>

<p>As water is, and has been in all history we
know of, so large a part of the earth’s mass, the
object of this writing is to show the wonderful
influence it exerts in the world’s affairs, and
the ample provision Nature has in store, and
where it is stored, for man, and animals, and
vegetation to bank on.</p>

<p>But, in passing, it is just that a name for many
recent years that has been a subject for ridicule
should be noticed with profound respect for his
wise and superior observations. This man for
whom I wish to speak a word of commendation
and admiration is Captain John Cleves Symmes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
who I am prepared to allow the honor of first
advancing the theory that the Earth is hollow,
and has been held up as the authority for finding
“Symmes’s Hole.” While the present writer had
never seen or read any of his arguments for such
a hole, the idea came originally, as if never
thought of by my worthy predecessor. To avoid
any charge of plagiarism, this topic will, therefore,
be treated as if never before thought of.</p>

<p>Assuming that the Earth is hollow, the purpose
will be in the following pages to show how
and why, and the great importance to the inhabitants
of the outside that it should be so. The
first proposition is, therefore, a hollow Earth
from causes heretofore named by centrifugal
force; next, that the inside is an ocean of fresh
water, with continents of land, and the outside
oceans of salt water and its continents, as we
have partially learned of them.</p>

<p>That the ice belts in each frigid zone are the
dividing lines between salt and fresh water. That
openings at the approach to either pole are at
least 1,500 miles across, and that a magnetic
compass above a latitude of eighty to eighty-eight
degrees will not keep its natural position at any
point within such latitude, but will, in its endeavor
to point the needle to the true center of
motion, lift up the point in order to keep the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
right bearing, or show some other embarrassment
or irregularity. Whoever explores at these
latitudes is, instead of going in a course directly
to the center of motion, unconsciously rounding
a circle toward the inside.</p>

<p>The flattened condition of the Earth at the
poles goes to accommodate both the claims of
being hollow and how it came to be so.</p>

<p>We are informed that every raindrop is hollow
falling through a short amount of space, and
how more reasonable to suppose the Earth’s great
mass to be so, revolving in an eternity of space.</p>

<p>It is more than presumable to suppose that
every planetary body in the universe is hollow,
and made so by the same fixed law for all flexible
bodies in revolution to become hollow. Are not
the rings of Saturn thus produced?</p>

<p>Here is a planet they tell us is seven hundred
times as large as the Earth, but its density only
ninety times as great. His mean diameter about
70,000 miles and compression one-tenth, so that
the polar diameter is 3,500 miles less, and the
equatorial 3,500 miles more than its mean,
thus duplicating largely the shape and globular
form of the Earth. Is it not reasonable, then, to
suppose that the lack of density has allowed its
revolutions to produce its series of rings, those
most dense being outside? And the whole order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
being such, that our position allows us to look
through them instead of on to an outside surface?</p>

<p>Jupiter has the same characteristics in diameters.
The mean, 85,000 miles; equatorial, 87,800;
polar, 82,200, a difference of 5,600 miles, which
means the same influences and same reason to
make it hollow. While 1,233 times as large as
the Earth, its density of substance is only 301
times as much. Here we have the two largest
planets, perhaps yet in their period of development
for being inhabited, in very like form relatively
as the Earth.</p>

<p>It may not be ill-timed to assert at this point
the belief that all planetary bodies are hollow
and cool, not one in a molten condition or giving
out heat, but only generating heat in their own
atmospheres, thus giving out light, which we, in
our ignorance, attribute to a mass of intense heat
or a globe in combustion. Such a condition seems
unreasonable to exist in a body traveling unlimited
space, which is cold beyond any degree of
ascertaining. The sun is subject to the same
conditions as the Earth, as far as obtaining heat,
and this work will claim that we receive no more
direct heat from the Sun than from Mars or
Venus.</p>

<p>Taking the first proposition, that in the absence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of friction there can be no heat or light,
the assumption is that the Sun generates its heat
and light by its wonderful revolution in its own
atmosphere. With a diameter of 860,000 miles,
and revolving in 25.38 days, the Sun is moving
through its atmosphere a mile in eight-tenths of
a second, and seventy-five miles a minute, and
4,500 per hour.</p>

<p>With an atmosphere of relative density of the
Earth’s, it is easy to see what a pyrotechnical and
electrical display this would reveal to the lens of
a telescope, giving the impression of fire on an
inconceivable magnitude. It seems unreasonable
that in the realm of Nature anything, or that anywhere
fuel can be found for an eternal fire except
in an old orthodox Hell.</p>

<p>To an observer on Mars or Venus, the earth
would, no doubt, present the same starlike appearance
that those planets do to our earthly eyes.</p>

<p>The electrical sparks on a trolley wire or
dynamo give the same expression to our eyes,
though in miniature, with no consciousness of
heat to our feelings.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if, with all the observations of
the Sun by telescopes, we have gained any knowledge
of its structure, but only of its revolutions,
size and movements, the same as the Earth. It
would be a very difficult subject to diagnose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
clearly as to its productions of animal and vegetable
life. The electrical influences through an
atmosphere proportionally deep with ours, with
its clouds that must exist in the same, could very
thoroughly obscure the surface of the Sun. Unless
at special intervals, when certain exposures
would be called Sun-spots, either on a great
space of continent or ocean.</p>

<p>The great flames of gases in the atmosphere
would give the impression, by telescopic view, of
a burning mass, when under these atmospheric
flames all is cool and calm.</p>

<p>In the writer’s mind there is no doubt but the
Sun is as favorable in condition for animal and
vegetable life as the Earth, and has both in proportional
greater variety and species. Nature
having no limit to designs, uses no duplicates,
never repeats herself in anything. No two grains
of seed, no two snow flakes, are ever just alike.
A million bushels of peas will have no two alike,
yet every one has its individuality as a pea.
Man cannot discriminate one blackbird from another
in a flock, but to the birds they are as individual
as mankind to each other. For these
reasons it is easy to see that every planet may be
peopled with different varieties of animal and
vegetable life as it is to find the variations in
different countries of the Earth. While the climate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of the Sun may be hotter than that of the
Earth, Nature can adapt itself to any condition
of heat or cold.</p>

<p>Thus far the argument has been chiefly in
considering the influence of heat by friction on
planetary surfaces. Later this influence will be
briefly taken up to demonstrate its interior effect
in producing earthquakes and volcanoes.</p>

<p>For a diversion, we will for a while consider
the effect of centrifugal force on the Earth. The
Earth gives many manifestations of said force in
the shape of the continents, courses of rivers,
outlets of bays and ranges of mountains. North
America gradually swings to the east as it approaches
the Equator; South America, at the
Equator, bulges most to the east. The mountain
ranges, the Rocky, Sierra Nevada and Cordilleras,
in North America, the Andes, in South
America, forming a barrier against the further
encroachment of the Pacific Ocean. The West
Coast of Africa is protected from the Atlantic
largely by the mountains of Morocco, including
the Black and White, running south, somewhat
protecting Senegambia, and then the Kong, with
other mountain ranges in upper and lower
Guinea, stop the encroachment on line of Gulf
of Guinea. In Asia, Hindustan has the Ghant
Mountains for a barrier, while another range of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
mountains holds the Peninsula of Malacca in
place. It will be plainly seen that all these points
of countries lean toward the Equatorial center
of motion. The islands of Oceanica, strung out
on the line of the Equator, also show the effect
of the Earth’s revolution.</p>

<p>The Island of Australia is apparently a new
production in embryo of a new continent in
future connection with some of the large adjacent
islands, and ultimately of most of the island
groups of Oceanica. The same result is likely
to follow with the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>

<p>The rivers are marked evidence of centrifugal
force on both continents. The largest, the Amazon,
running nearly on line of the Equator and
emptying there. All the rivers, almost without
exception, north of the equator to the Arctic circle
run southeast when they can, and at their
mouths tend that way. Those south tend northeast
where the face of the country will admit.
The Nile, a freak river, is about the only marked
exception. On the north outflows like the Yukon,
McKenzie, and Great Fish in North America;
the Yenisei and Lena, and many smaller streams
of Europe and Asia flow to the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>These last named streams so far from the great
center of motion and on account of the marked
incline to the country toward the polar centers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
head that way and no doubt contribute largely
to the great inflow of water to the internal ocean.
The west coasts of both continents are marked
for their dearth of great streams. The open sea
that some Arctic explorers have presumed to be
about the poles is no doubt the beginning of the
fresh water ocean.</p>

<p>The open sea problem introduces the importance
of this disquisition. If there is an open sea,
which is in all probability true, it must be the
open door to an inside world as truly as the coming
back from those high latitudes and entering
open sea is the evidence of our habitable outside
world.</p>

<p>With all deference to the reports of Arctic
explorers, it is very doubtful if they really know
their actual positions or latitudes with freaky
compasses and unfavorable conditions about
them, so that their stories and adventures while
honestly told need to be taken with a grain of
salt. They tell us of witnessing the breaking off
of icebergs of mammoth size from glaciers,
which, no doubt, is true. It would be true if
one was seen big as the Capitol at Washington,
or as large as the largest Egyptian pyramid, but
doubtful if they ever saw one one-tenth as large
as the latter or as large as the former.</p>

ICEBERGS.</h2>
</div>

<p>The venture will be taken here to consider and
explain the character and formation of a big
true iceberg which it is supposable change their
location to both inside and outside waters.</p>

<p>As already said, the ice belt is the dividing
line between salt and fresh waters.</p>

<p>This being the case, large expanses of the
ocean in the Arctic region must be frozen over.
As water is an exception to most everything else
by growing lighter as it grows colder, it rises
above its water level. Without this provision of
Nature, our lakes would become solid masses of
ice, and rivers would become mountains, thus extinguishing
fish and producing a mass so deep
and solid that a summer season would hardly
melt away. This can be evidenced in any tub
of water standing out in a cold night. Water
does not congeal entirely on the surface, but rises
in frozen particles from below like cream on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
milk. This is shown by its rising and swelling
up in the center and pressing the outside of the
vessel to bursting.</p>

<p>A pond, lake or river frozen so thickly as to
bear up heavy loaded teams of horses, and armies
of men with all their equipages will be materially
arched as it leaves the banks. An evidence
of this comes when rising and cracking with
loud reports and at the thawing up and yielding
of pressure on the banks when loud explosions
like blasts or firing of cannons will occur, caused
by the settling and cracking of the ice.</p>

<p>As the ocean depths are great and the Arctic
night of long duration, the fresh-water portions
to a great depth congeal, and rising form a mass
of ice inconceivable to temperate climes, both
in height and area. Imagine what an iceberg
must have been in starting from seventy-fifth to
eightieth parallel of latitude and floated through
all kinds of weather till midsummer, arriving off
the coasts of Newfoundland, and then 300 to
500 feet high with seven times its height under
water and so large as to take hours and even
days or weeks to pass the main mass of ice and
its fragments that have sloughed off. Has any
explorer ever seen such a body of ice break off
from a glacier that must have covered scores of
miles square when it started?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>As an arrow shot into the air bends its course
to follow the heavy end, as truly do the heavy
elements in the water manifest themselves at the
center of the Earth’s motion, and the saltness of
the Equatorial waters is much stronger than approaching
the polar holes, which last term might
be used with good reason instead of poles.</p>

<p>There seems to be with all Arctic explorers
the obstacle presenting itself, termed the ice
belt. This obstacle is suggestive, and leads the
way to base the following conclusions:</p>

<p>That the water at this point has become so
freshened, as to admit of such a wide freezing
belt, but that the boundary line is made between
salt water and fresh.</p>

<p>It is not in place here to describe a glacier until
the cause and origin is explained, which will
properly come after considering the water influences
from inside.</p>

<p>The next purpose will be to show and aim to
prove that the Earth is hollow and supplied with
an ocean of fresh water and habitable land.</p>

<p>As said before the theory of an open sea gives
the inference of a new climate and country, therefore
now, what evidence, actual or circumstantial
can be adduced?</p>

<p>It is claimed by Arctic navigators beyond all
their attempts to reach beyond the ice belt, geese,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
duck, and other wild fowl continue to fly and
seem to be in quest of food which they must obtain
in waters beyond the ice belt.</p>

<p>The existence of an open sea beyond the ice
belt has for years been conceded. As no explorer
has reached much nearer than 750 miles of
the supposed poles, it is reasonable to suppose that
the open sea, so-called, but really a hole must be
nearly fifteen hundred miles in diameter. Various
evidences have settled that question in the
minds of navigators, the most important of which
is that the sea fowls still fly beyond the reach
of man’s explorations. The fact alone that wild
geese, ducks, and other sea fowl go on to some
feeding ground is enough to settle all doubts
or arguments for or against the theory of an
open sea of fresh water around the supposed
poles. Conclusive reasons are that no water
fowl or fish can live in an ocean of salt water.
Strictly salt waters do not furnish any food; but
only in bodies fed by streams of fresh waters,
as in bays, inlets and mouths of rivers, and adjacent
to the coast line of continents or islands
where fresh water from springs and rainfalls
contribute to produce growth and substances suitable
for food.</p>

<p>It was observed by the navigator, Ross, that
moose, reindeer, wolves, musk-ox, white bear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and foxes seek winter quarters toward the north
rather than to the south, and return when the
season becomes favorable, with their young. Fish
are noticed to come south but not to return.</p>

<p>As to water fowl, how far they could follow
this opening into the center of the Earth, the
writer will leave for others to conjecture.</p>

<p>It has often been a query from whence came
the Arctic elephants, the remains of which are
found so plentifully on the north shores of Siberia,
some of which during the last century have
been in such a state of preservation as that their
flesh was eatable by bears and wolves.</p>

<p>Why were they protected by a covering of
hair if not originating in a colder climate than
exists south of the Arctic Circle?</p>

<p>Do they not still exist in the interior, or have
they passed out with the great Auk, a former
external resident?</p>

<p>Why are the latitudes nearest the poles the
favorite fishing grounds for whales? Is not the
interior ocean of fresh water their natural breeding
ground and from thence passing out through
Behring Strait and other channels into the outer
waters? Can some scientist give us reliable information
as to where whales propagate most,
and why it is necessary for whaling expeditions
to seek high latitudes for their catch?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>The hole, fifteen hundred miles across, would
not give any conscious impression of there being
such an opening. You could not stand and
inspect it like looking down a well. This hole
opens into a new world unexplored by man, unless
it is possible that Sir John Franklin and
the Aeronaut Nansen unintentionally drifted in
and were unable to navigate themselves out.</p>

<p>It must also, in marking out this theory, be
admitted that as the center of the Earth is approached
this opening must be somewhat enlarged,
and must assume a concave shape from
the center; such being the case, the diameter
must increase from one thousand to two thousand
miles or more, which is very likely to be
the fact. With the motion or revolution of the
Earth, the water would assume this condition
on principle of the swinging of a pail of water
over the head, and would merely be a placid
ocean as boundless to the eye as the waters on
the surface.</p>

<p>In these expanses of water, it is quite reasonable
to presume that islands and large bodies
of land may exist the same as outside, and that
many fossil specimens thought to have existed
on the outer surface in an early antiquity may
have originated in the center of the Earth and
may even still exist; their ancient skeletons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
having been thrown to the Earth’s surface by
the centrifugal forces of water in the same way
that all the different stratas of rock have been
cast up and mixed in one grand conglomeration
from the Earth’s center to its circumference.
These facts seem clearly to prove by these migratory
birds and animals: First an open sea;
second it must be fresh water or mostly so;
third, it must produce or contain desirable food
elements different from what exist in the ocean
on the outside, on which these birds can live
when they reach their breeding grounds from
which they are reported to return with largely
augmented numbers. Now this consistent query
can arise: Do they stop at a near point after
passing this great boundary line of ice and find
suitable and pleasant feeding grounds, or go on
500 or 1,000 miles farther? At that distance,
the water is more likely to be modified in temperature
and better adapted to their tastes and
comfort. It seems quite right to assume that
they come to inland seas, and pleasant bays, and
sounds supplied with food from their shores and
feeding grounds, rather than being supplied with
anything existing on external parts of the Earth;
otherwise, their supply must all be drawn under
the ice belt or pass through this great Arctic filter.
Again this thought comes up. How did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
these birds get sight of or learn of this internal
feeding, and probably breeding ground? As
migratory birds usually fly at great height, they
would have an advantage over man in seeing
this open ocean, as it is reasonable to think they
may have bred as well as fed there. It is only
a natural sequence of their migration in and out
of this belt or ice circle, just as we recognize
their flight north and south with the season’s
changes.</p>

<p>If they go there by instinct, they merely do
what is credited to the realm of life, considered
lower in the scale of thoughts than man; but
if by exploration and reason, then man must take
a lower scale in calculation than the goose. To
conclude this point. If birds live on vegetation,
there must be an abundant supply of fresh
water to produce it. If they live on fish, there
must be the same sufficiency of fresh water in
which to breed, feed, and live. If the birds
breed, they must have hospitable shores on which
to dwell and rest, and favoring skies to contribute
to their various wants in order to exist.</p>

<p>Their instincts or reason will never take them
where the conditions will not admit of food and
drink, rest, shelter, and protection.</p>

<p>One other conclusive evidence that our icebergs
are not formed by the breaking off from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the terminals of glaciers is the fact of frequently
finding them in midocean carrying such passengers
as wolves, foxes, white bear, and other
specimens of Arctic animals. The solidity of
the iceberg is much against the glacial origin,
the glacier being made up of a conglomerate
mass formed by snow, rain and spring waters,
so much so as to be impossible to keep intact
to any great bulk. The formation of the iceberg
in its method must be a solid mass.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV.<br />


GULF STREAM.</h2>
</div>

<p>The first witness from the interior will be the
Gulf Stream, the most phenomenal stream of
water known to the Earth. This great outlet,
authorities tell us, is the result of waters rushing
around from the Caribbean Sea through the
Gulf of Mexico and out through the Strait of
Florida, thus giving force enough to be manifest
for more than three thousand miles to the
coast of Ireland to give her the climate that
christened her the Emerald Isle; from Ireland
and the British Isles, its influence is felt to the
coast of Norway.</p>

<p>The water is much warmer than at other
points after leaving the Bahamas with different
marine conditions, such as containing no jelly
fish, or showing sparkling waters by night and
being always avoided by the whales and other
tenants that are in adjoining waters. It is also
claimed by those who have sailed many times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
through it that the color of the water is so different
as to be quickly noticeable as vessels enter
the Stream. How such a stream can originate
with such force in a reservoir like the Atlantic,
connected around through the Caribbean
Sea and returning to itself, is as obscure to
the writer’s mind as to how a man can succeed
in lifting himself in a bushel basket. A man that
can adopt this conclusion ought to apply his energies
to developing a machine for perpetual motion.</p>

<p>The Gulf Stream is, no doubt, an enormous
spring tainted with sulphur, like many of the
springs in Florida and up the coast as far as
Charleston, whose waters are warmed from the
same influence as the Gulf Stream, from passing
up through a deep strata heated by volcanic
influences so common in Central America. Its
sulphurous taint will account for the absence of
whales and jelly fish in its waters, in which waters
of similar nature fish are never found. This
sulphurous condition may account for the stormy
features that prevail along its course. It may
be claimed that the waters would smell of sulphur
so as to be detected, but such is not necessarily
the case; from springs in Florida that flow
strong sulphurous water, many visitors will not
drink at the spring, but after aërating an hour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
it will be drank at hotel tables and from water
urns without a suspicion of its being sulphurous.
The contact with salt water at the great
depth from which the Stream originates diminishes
any odor before reaching the surface and
quite likely imparts the noticeable change in
color. The deep-sea soundings off the coast
of Bahama is another reason that the Stream
originates there. It is claimed to be almost impossible
at the commencement of the stream to
get reliable soundings, as evidently sounding
leads would be sensibly affected by the powerful
current of water flowing outward.</p>

<p>The next evidence offered is, where does the
enormous amount of water come from to supply
our lake systems? Nearly all of the large
lakes of the world are located in the highest parts.
Lake Geneva 1,226 feet above the sea level, receives
the muddy waters of the Rhone, but has
so much other inflow as a spring as to discharge
its waters blue and clear. Lake Constance is
1,290 feet above the sea and 912 feet deep; the
Rhine rising at an elevation of 7,600 feet enters
this lake. In 1770, the waters rose in one
hour twenty feet above ordinary limit. It is
said to contain twenty-five species of fish, including
salmon. Onega and Ladoga are high
from sea levels, and by canal, connect with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of the headwaters of the Volga. Titicaca, 12,800
feet above the sea, 720 feet deep near the shore,
and probably very deep in the middle, contains
many islands and abounds in remains of Peruvian
architecture. Superior, 627 feet above the sea
and mean depth about 1,000 feet, never freezing
over except about the shores, and presents
a temperature of about 45 degrees.</p>

<p>These are only a few in different countries
to which the position is universal, for both great
bodies of fresh water as well as small ones, as
the general impression with people is that lakes
are usually in low lands, while the opposite is
the true state.</p>

<p>How few people in this country ever thought
of our great internal seas of fresh water, Superior,
Huron, Michigan, and Ontario, being on
the highest lands between the ocean and the
Rocky Mountains, yet such is the case. From
these great fountains flow the waters that plunge
down Niagara Falls, while a larger portion,
it is thought, has a subterranean outlet through
Lake Ontario, and uniting with the Niagara
current to form the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Whence come these waters into those great
lakes? They have no important rivers flowing
in, and their waters are frequently highest in
August and September when the country is commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
suffering by drouth. If the supply were
rain water, this whole surface would freeze, but
spring water is exempt until well exposed to
the air for some time. The lands about Lake
Superior rise quite abruptly, and as you ascend
the hills, and riding from Ashland to Duluth,
will see hundreds of small lakes, and from Two
Harbors north as you ascend for fifty miles you
see the same state of things till you come to the
divide within less than 100 miles, when the waters
go west into the Mississippi valley and north to
Hudson Bay, and east and south to the Atlantic.
Are these lakes supplied with rain and snows?
If so, where does the water collect, and how does
it get into this elevation? A subterranean river
is supposed to run between Superior and Ontario,
on account of similar fish being caught in
each lake at particular seasons, but absent in
Ontario at other times.</p>

<p>The lakes named are only mentioned for their
importance; we will now call attention to lakes
universally. Whoever reads this subject will be
obliged to come to only one conclusion as to
the general locality of lakes. Take our Adirondack
region, with its thousands of pure, clear
lakes hidden away among the rugged hills. The
White mountain country where lakes abound.
Chautauqua on its elevated ground, Mt. Desert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
in the ocean with its Eagle lake and others 1,200
feet above the sea. Lakes and living ponds, full
of lilies, on Block Island. All through the mountains
and wilds of Maine, and so on in every
state the same condition exists, till you get to
the level and prairie states where upheavals are
rare for producing lakes and springs.</p>

<p>If a reader will peruse in “Picturesque America”
the descriptive scenes on the French Broad
River and the wonders through Delaware Water
Gap, it is very doubtful if the various displays
of waterfalls and profusion of springs and lakes
will impress him with the idea that they are
to be attributed to special rainfall in that locality.
One particular evidence ought to be
enough to dispel any such conclusion.</p>

<p>To quote from page 100: “As one of the
wonders of the Gap must be counted the marvelous
lake upon Tammany; a lake so singular
that popular superstition has been tempted to
add a final touch to its surpassing strangeness,
and declare it has no bottom. As if in quaint climax
to her wild work, Nature, after riving the
mountain to its very base, here places beside the
chasm on the very apex of the lofty peak a peaceful
lake.”</p>

<p>This feature of lakes could be extended indefinitely,
but something must be said about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
smaller influences that produce them. Every
lake is but a mammoth spring, or reservoir of
numerous springs that feed into its base. The
provision by nature of this inexhaustible reservoir
of fresh water is beyond doubt the most
essential of any other bounty bestowed upon
every living thing on Earth’s surface. The principle
of centrifugal motion and power is here developed
to its highest advantage.</p>

<p>Every man that has ever turned a grindstone
at early morning to prepare a dull scythe for its
day’s work, has no doubt observed the result
of frequent pouring on of water. If he turned
slow, it would drizzle off at the bottom, supposed
to obey the Law of Gravitation; but if he turned
just fast enough, he could keep about a pint
of water on the surface of a stone four inches
thick and two feet in diameter. Increasing the
speed results in throwing the water off in all
directions.</p>

<p>If yarn or cloth wet from a tank or vat is put
in a tub latticed outside and subjected to rapid
revolutions, it can be thoroughly dried in a
brief time. The process of separating cream
from milk is done on the same principle by which
butter can be made in ten minutes’ time from
milking.</p>

<p>The familiar trick of whirling a pail of water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
over one’s head, is complete proof in itself that
water seeks the surface and center of motion,
and that all these results are from centrifugal
force. A funnel of large, or any capacity, filled
and a plug at the bottom removed to admit its
discharge, will evidence that motion at once
forms a circle, and that the center is bare while
the outside is full.</p>

<p>At this point it may be well to call attention
to another feature in the river system. The water
on the grindstone will give force to this suggestion.
At a certain speed the water will tend
to the outside of the stone; below speed required
to do that, the tendency will be toward the
center of the stone, or strictly toward the center
of the Earth’s motion.</p>

<p>Now let us see what the river system says.
Look on your maps and see about where the
common divide occurs, which is seemingly not
far from the 50th parallel, where centrifugal
force is apparently not strong enough to carry
the waters toward the Equator, and the principal
waters flow toward Symmes’s Hole.</p>

<p>Look on your maps.</p>

<p>On the 40th parallel sailors have what they call
a roaring sea, which is approximately near the
divide of waters, going either toward the poles
or toward the Equator.</p>

DAILY MOTION.</h2>
</div>

<p>Nature seems to have just the right adjustment
in all its affairs, whether in coloring of
flowers, season for growth, flavoring of fruits,
supplies for animal and vegetable life, and instincts
for everything created, to adapt them to
living purposes.</p>

<p>So in the Earth’s diurnal revolution of 24
hours, supposing it was slowed to 25 hours, we
should have less wind and tides, less warmth and
more land free from the encroachment of the sea.</p>

<p>Increase the speed to 23 hours would give
us more warmth by greater friction, increase
the flow of our springs, give higher tides, and
make most of the present commercial seaports of
the world take seats farther back, as millions of
acres of land now available would be flooded
every tide.</p>

<p>The moon, we are told, has little or no atmosphere.
It is pronounced cold and uninhabitable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
This all looks reasonable. Being only a little
over 2,000 miles in diameter and a revolution
about like the Earth through a thin atmosphere,
it is easy to see the lack of friction to produce
warmth, and therewith the proper constituents
to sustain life. This is an easy one and readily
disposed of.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI.<br />


EARTHQUAKES.</h2>
</div>

<p>It is doubtful if the Earth’s crust exceeds, or
equals 1,000 miles in thickness. The outside is
held from flying to pieces by the atmosphere,
which is a sort of tire to the earth, while the inside
is constantly pressing from effect of centrifugal
force. These two factors must meet
somewhere.</p>

<p>On the outside, near the ice belt, the water
pressure gets the best of the inner forces and
drives the waters into Symmes’s Hole. In the
Earth the centrifugal force has advantage until
reaching the surface; but if a big hole could be
cut at the Equator through to the center, no
doubt a man could jump into it in safety and
cease to fall as he cushioned against centrifugal
influence in his descent. Earthquakes are only
the effects of internal pressure of water to get
to the surface, at times bursting large reservoirs,
producing tremblings, and at others with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
great force throwing up hills and mountains
from the tops of which the fountains of water
burst forth. At other times they are produced
by the contact of water with heated elements
in volcanoes, creating the commotion leading
to the volcanic eruption, the latter of which can
only be produced by contact of fire and water.</p>

<p>It is believed that this is the complete and
brief explanation of earthquake causes.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII.<br />


VOLCANOES.</h2>
</div>

<p>The volcano is nothing more than a local fire,
as much in connection with the Earth’s surface
as the furnace fire built in a man’s basement
to warm his house, or in his stove to
cook his breakfast. When the fuel that is used
in either one is consumed, the fire goes out,
which is a common result in both cases. Of
all the volcanoes known to have existed as evidenced
by their craters, fully three-fourths have
become extinct.</p>

<p>Now what causes the volcano? The Earth is
filled with immense supplies of fuel, consisting
in stores of coal, sulphur, oil, gas, limestone, etc.
While it is claimed that at the imaginary axis
of the Earth there can be no friction, yet when
the surface is approached with all its weight of
mountains and continents, here friction begins
to put in its work. It is very doubtful if any
volcano exists, or ever has existed whose fires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
go to the depth of 500 miles, and more likely
not half that distance.</p>

<p>On the outside of this circle, of 25,000 miles
it is only reasonable to expect an enormous
strain. The abrasion of limestone found in huge
masses will, by process of heat, convert them
into lime. The contact with water, universal
throughout the Earth, will start the volcano,
which by slaking, this small amount of rock
converted into lime will generate a heat that
may ignite and produce more lime, or reach other
combustibles, which may be set on fire by this;
or when in contact with other substances, this
would lead to reservoirs of oil and gas, and
deposits of coal and sulphur. These when ignited
may remain in a slight slumbering condition and
burn for ages, but water will be the constant
aggressor and from time to time will manifest
itself by coming in contact with these burning
forces thus producing the volcanic eruptions
and in time will be the conqueror, and the crater
of the volcano will become a lake, of which evidences
exist all over the Earth. That volcanoes
are only local, the same as fires in our
houses, is fully evident from the fact that they
burn, and go out. This theory of producing volcanic
eruptions can be easily demonstrated in
every kitchen or casting shop in the country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Kettles of hot fat or melted metals when brought
in contact with water will cause a miniature
eruption at short notice. It is common to speak
of volcanoes emitting smoke, but it is rare that
such cases are ever a fact, but instead of smoke,
we should say steam. The result of friction to
produce effects, we claim, is well illustrated in
shipments of cotton. Cotton shipped from India
in the vessel’s hold, rarely, if ever, takes fire.
From this country it is no unusual thing, and
why? In India they bind the bales with jute
or hemp, while in this country with straps of
iron. In the ship’s hold, there is, of course, a
constant motion and rubbing together of great
weight of bales which ofttimes generates the
fire in the cargo. This is the way the volcano
is started, but sooner or later, water will put
it out. All volcanic eruptions are credited with
throwing out great volumes of water, steam,
mud, ashes, stones, lava and sulphur. During
earthquake convulsions which generally precede
volcanic eruptions, the world over there is
a bursting out of fresh springs as well as an
increase in the present existing flows.</p>


<h3>WHAT ARE VOLCANOES FOR?</h3>

<p>If they are, as is claimed by some, for vents to
the interior molten condition, why do they become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
extinct, so many of them, and almost invariably
become lakes inside their craters?</p>

<p>With the whole center of the Earth a molten
mass, there ought to be fire enough to keep
them going incessantly. Where does the water
come from to keep up a constant outpour of
steam and vapor in locations where it seldom
rains?</p>

<p>It would seem as if the small amount of rain
or snow that fell would get pretty well dried out
before it arrived at a point to create an eruption
by contact with melted rock, or that such a
quantity could keep up steam in such an immense
cauldron. There is no reason to presume
that a drop of rain water ever enters a volcanic
crater, except what may fall into its open mouth,
which will be impossible.</p>

<p>Have Volcanoes any specific use in Earth
economics? Do they tend to open up water
courses from the interior and by their upheavals
on the continents and islands of the Earth create
natural elevated reservoirs from which the lower
regions of Earth can be irrigated? Do they not
send out certain gases to mingle in the atmosphere,
producing favorable results in vegetation
and animal life? Are not the vicinities of volcanoes
noted for the fine fruits and wines in latitudes
in which they grow?</p>

RAINFALLS.</h2>
</div>

<p>This chapter being devoted to rainfalls, a few
introductory observations may be in order. The
essential need on Earth’s surface for growth of
vegetation, and the sustenance of life, depending
thereon in some form, is in universal irrigation,
which Nature failed to furnish by its internal
provision of water with its outflow of springs and
lakes, except by artificial use. The rainfall on
the Earth is no more intended for filling of
springs, lakes and seas than it is for supplying us
with fuel. It is simply a provision for surface
watering of vegetation, and has no more effect
on the existence of living springs and subterranean
outflow of water than the eclipse of the
moon. There never was a rainfall, except, perhaps,
in Noah’s time, that wet the general surface
of the country to the depth of three feet, and
rarely one-half of that. It is generally called a
good, soaking rain that moistens the bottom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the potato hills, and to wet what the soil will hold
one to two feet requires a prodigious amount of
water. It is claimed by proprietors of orange
groves that a volume of water of six inches in
depth is requisite to thoroughly irrigate the grove.
If the claim that rain has no effect on the supplies
of springs and lakes be true, you will ask
why it is that after a long drouth and a heavy
rainfall, the springs resume running, and water
returns into wells that have for a time been dry?
The effect on those sources of supply is simply
the same as results from wetting a sponge to take
up water which will not absorb and be taken up in
a dry one. You can easily be convinced of this
effect. To show that water will run uphill or
away from the Earth: The surface of the Earth
becoming saturated, and in some places penetrating
into the seams and crevices of rock and soil,
at once forms a medium of attraction for the
waters below to follow. Another valid reason is
the general condition of the atmosphere from the
time of drouth to a condition of moisture when
it becomes really a mammoth sponge after being
dampened. Against the claim that rainfall has
little or no influence in raising or producing
springs or lakes, or living wells, this question
naturally arises regarding springs, which has in
a measure been answered. It is, however, a pertinent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
question, and a pleasant one to answer
fully.</p>

<p>In the summer season, most commonly of any,
the air becomes hot and dry. The surface of the
Earth loses the moisture of the air’s influence,
together with the Sun’s heat evaporating the
dampness, becomes generally arid, and fails
thereby to be a conductor of the moisture from
below.</p>

<p>As a season of very dry atmosphere occurs
for months at times, the soil becomes correspondingly
dry and dusty to quite a depth. From this
cause the springs and water in wells recede and
sink away. It is an easy matter to find people
who have witnessed the following seeming phenomena
in times of drouth: After a period of
weeks or months of drouth before any rainfall
has occurred at all, the fountains, long dry,
often commence to run, and wells begin to fill
with water, and this without a drop of rain.</p>

<p>Just here comes the pleasant task of answering
the question fully: How can this occur without
a soaking rain?</p>

<p>At such times, when the Earth and all nature
is thirsting for water, and every fountain seems
to have dried up forever, the day will come which
will bring these evidences.</p>

<p>The aged will complain of their rheumatism;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
men’s bones will ache; geese will wash in the
dust; the peacock will scream; birds, beasts and
vegetation will feel a humidity in the air and
intuitions that rain is near. As the atmosphere
has felt the approach and preparation for rain
some time in advance, so all Nature feels its
effects. To illustrate the burned or dry condition
of the air, you may consider this test: Take a
pail of water, and a dry sponge, big as your head,
and lay the sponge on the surface, and it will
take a long time for the sponge to absorb the
water and become fully saturated. Wet the
sponge before the test and squeeze it dry as you
can, and lay it on, and it will fill rapidly and
quickly. Pour a pail of water on the floor and try
the same experiment. Your sponge will not
fill at all if dry, only a little as it comes in contact
with the water; but moisten it as before, and
press it nearly dry, and throw on the puddle
of water, and it will drink itself full at once,
drawing up the water like a pump. You cannot
wipe up a floor with a dry sponge.</p>

<p>The springs and wells that have dried and receded
a short distance from their usual level
from lack of moisture in the air that penetrates
the surface, quickly feel a returning moist condition
and are drawn by the same influence upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
as the water climbs up through the damp
sponge.</p>

<p>The atmosphere performs the same duty as
the sponge, and this answers why the springs
and wells resume running before a drop of rain
has fallen, and which, when it comes in copious
quantities, still adds to the general effect of
making a stronger draft on the fountains below.</p>

<p>Another question proper to ask scientists is
this: If the rainfall affects springs and lakes, how
is it that the analysis of mineral springs in all
quarters of the globe is not affected by every
change of season? How can the waters of
Saratoga, Carlsbad, Waukeska, Kissengen or of
any other such spring be relied on for uniform
assays? How can this great variety of springs
come in such near proximity to each other and
possess such distinctive curative properties as
at Saratoga, for example? Within a radius of
two or three miles are springs, one of which is
a cathartic, another a diuretic, another emetic,
another tonic, and so on, no two alike, but retain
their individuality through all times, wet or dry?
They are affected only in amount of flow by the
same atmospheric conditions of either dryness
or moisture, as just described.</p>

<p>When the atmosphere is heavily charged with
moisture, it becomes a mammoth sponge, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
this condition of air, evidently, is what precipitates
thunder showers in the summer. As all the
hills and mountains are the result of water upheavals,
they are for this reason the reservoirs
of water for watering the Earth, and therefore
quicker to respond to atmospheric conditions
than the plains.</p>

<p>It is almost without exception that thunder
showers form their nucleus on the heads of
mountains and the tops of hills.</p>

<p>After a shower let us see the condition and
results. The face of Nature smiles after its refreshing
wash; every tree and plant has drunk
its foliage full of new life; the air’s sultriness
has changed to freshness. All animated life
seems to take a fresh lease, and as the clouds roll
away and the quickly swollen streams rush to
the rivers, lakes and oceans, it seems as if almost
a deluge had passed by.</p>

<p>The remarks, “What a lovely shower!” “What
a much needed rain!” “What lots of good it will
do!” etc., pass between neighbors. Farmer
Smith comes along and says, in reply to the
shower being such a cracker, that he went into
his garden to set out cabbage plants, and down
little over an inch the ground was dry as powder;
that while this will do lots of good to grass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and “sich,” it wants a good soaker to get down
to the bottom of the potato hills.</p>

<p>Such is the history of most of our copious
showers that flood everything for half an hour,
but not a drop reaches the roots of forest trees
of any depth, or does anything more than to
temporarily wet and freshen the surface.</p>

<p>Such being the case on the prairies and
unbroken plains, the evaporation of two or three
days’ sun leaves them in almost the condition
of a desert. This was the case in our new
States, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Indian
Territory, which, now so productive, were, as our
early Geography describes them, before the soil
was broken to hold the rain for a while, the
Great American Desert.</p>

<p>On a hot day the air in the valleys is still
and suffocating. Climbing up from the valley
to the hill or mountain tops, you find a cool
and refreshing breeze; the moisture in the air
is becoming condensed. Here is where the
philosophy of lightning seems to work a prominent
part. The cold currents of air and moisture,
collecting, seem to come in contact with
this subtle and wonderful agent, and the result
is like fire to powder, a vivid flash and explosion.
Stand on the plain on a sultry day and
watch that little white crest of what we call a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
thunderhead. The farmer who has hay down
will notice it with a little anxiety. The sailor
will think of his sails, and the picnickers will
think about going home. Soon a flash, and a
dark base is forming. Soon the rumble of thunder
is heard; the girls with their bonnets on
begin to look worried. The captain on his yacht
is giving orders to reef sails, and Farmer Jones
and his boys are cocking and pitching hay for
their lives.</p>

<p>The little white-capped clouds of an hour ago
have turned into a black and threatening massed
park of artillery. Every discharge deepens and
darkens the advancing column.</p>

<p>Just as the vessel’s sails are dropped and
snugly reefed, just as the farmer rushes his
team, with load of hay or grain, into his barn,
and the picnic is almost under cover, the big drops
of rain begin to patter. Another flash and quick
report; a scream from the girls, nearly as sharp,
and they rush for shelter, and down comes a
torrent of rain.</p>

<p>A slight cessation, another flash, and, like
shaking a tree of fruit, every electrical explosion
seems to shake down a fresh reserve of rain
drops. This is in keeping with the theory that
after great battles the cannonading produces a
copious rainfall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>It is a method at times adopted by military
garrisons when destitute of water, when the
atmosphere is in a favorable condition for rain,
to get out a battery of artillery and have a
season of vigorous firing, and generally with
successful results.</p>

<p>And while all this grand and complete arrangement
supplies vegetation with its bathing
and drinking, as said before, it has nothing to
do with the living and lasting supply of our
springs, lakes and rivers. They are fed from a
never failing and almost unchanging source—that
is, by the immense supply taken in at the
polar holes in a river over 4,000 miles wide at
each end of the Earth’s axis.</p>

<p>That the presumption of rainfall furnishing
the supply for all of our lakes, springs and wells
has never been questioned seems almost discreditable
to the observing talent of our age.
Whatever the character of rainfall, either by
protracted storm or sudden and copious showers,
it cannot escape our notice that the largest portion
of the water runs from the highlands to the
lowlands into the gulches and small streams,
and thence to the rivers, into the ocean; so
that the percentage of water retained by the
soil is much smaller than that which runs away.</p>

<p>In our Western prairies, the country formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
called the Indian Territory, the soil was covered
with an almost waterproof matting of grass
roots, on which, when showers fell, the penetration
was so slight that in a very few days
evaporation left them parched and dried. Since
the settling up of our territories, which were
once termed deserts, the soil has been broken
by the farmer’s plow, thus admitting the rainfall
to be longer retained in the surface soil,
which fact has led to the development of lands
once considered barren to become some of the
most fruitful grounds in our domain.</p>

<p>Another peculiar feature of climatic change
may be mentioned here, whereas until recent
years thunder showers and storms were almost
unknown in many of our Western States and
in the Pacific States also, till now these storms
and showers, with their electrical disturbances,
are nearly as common as in older States.</p>

<p>Another feature of weather which has seemed
to develop in recent years is that of milder
winters in our Northern States and colder
freaks in the Southern; snows and frosts reaching
States which rarely ever had such experiences,
and the burdens of snows becoming much
less in States which always expected a long
season of sleighing.</p>

<p>It is proposed to venture the following reasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
as conducive to much of this change in weather
conditions of the country at large. First, the
general denuding of our forests, which evidently
has much influence on the water courses. Next,
the settling up of the whole country, and location
of cities and towns from ocean to ocean, all
quite evenly distributed, and in a great portion
of them large amounts of machinery, composed
of iron and steel, producing a great amount of
friction and electrical influence in their workings;
besides the almost innumerable fires from
furnaces, factories and households, discharging
their heat into the upper air. Again, the railroad
system, with its millions of tons of steel rails,
make a magnetic connection between every State
and almost every county in forming one grand
combination. The rush of thousands of trains
all over the country, with their friction by
wheels on the tracks, and the rush through the
atmosphere, cannot fail to influence in largely
equalizing the same. Still another potent
influence must exist in the almost unlimited
number of wires for telephone and telegraph
purposes, which make all the electrical combinations
more complete than anything else.
If all these things combine, it does not seem
strange that magnetic and electric currents and
conditions of our weather throughout the
country should be somewhat modified.</p>

SPRINGS.</h2>
</div>

<p>The person in full enjoyment of health rarely
ever appreciates it to the fullness that he will
on being deprived of it and have its welcome
return.</p>

<p>The bounties of Nature are so great and
common that they fail to attract our attention
to the extent of some trifles that come new into
our way from day to day. One of the greatest
provisions of Nature, as universal as air and
Earth, is the millions of springs gushing up
through the pores of the Earth in every country
and clime. To make this provision of fresh
water ample, needs very large reservoirs for
supplies. The amplitude of this reservoir, if
the situation is as claimed in this book, it is
believed everybody will admit. To prove that
this supply comes from such a general source
a class of witnesses must be brought out. One
of the most important must be the feeding of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
our great lakes on high altitudes. These great
bodies of fresh water are universally credited
with enormous depths of pure, clear water, such
as never could exist as the result of shed water.
Many of them practically have no streams feeding
them, but, without regard to weather conditions
of seasons, pour forth enormous bodies
of water without change of volume. Lake Superior
will be taken again as a prominent witness.
Here is an inland sea, on the highest ground
between the ocean and Rocky Mountains, so
large that vessels can sail on it for days out of
sight of land. Not a river of any importance
flows into it, the country around it not admitting
the formation of a large stream.</p>

<p>The water during the hottest summer months
sustains a uniform temperature of forty-five
degrees, and is as clear as crystal.</p>

<p>The outflow from this lake furnishes the great
river passing through the Sault Ste. Marie,
through which passes a greater tonnage of vessels
than through the Suez canal, and most of
them of very large draft. This river with the
combined waters of Lake Michigan and Lake
Huron passes on through the Detroit River and
Lake Erie and over Niagara Falls. It is also
claimed that from Lake Superior a large subterranean
stream flows into Lake Ontario from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
which lake the stream in junction with Niagara
river forms the St. Lawrence, the river so
copious in its flow as to be immune from floods.</p>

<p>This question is in point: Where does this
enormous supply of water come from to supply
Lake Superior?</p>

<p>Without taking single witnesses, we will call
up groups. Take the various great lakes of the
world, Europe, Asia and Africa, where all great
rivers seem to have their sources in some lake.</p>

<p>As to rainfall if that originates these streams,
and if so, how is their flow kept so uniform, or
is it from a steady, unfailing source, as would
come from the inside ocean of supply?</p>

<p>Lakes of enormous depth exist in the Sierra
Nevada, and Rocky Mountains, as Pyramid
Lake, Donner, Tahoe and Crater Lakes. In our
Adirondacks are thousands of lakes, in Vermont
and New Hampshire, and in the White Mountain
region, throughout the mountain portions
of Maine, in West Virginia, and the Carolinas,
and in other high and mountainous sections lakes
abound. As we come to the low country there
are few witnesses to call, as the only body of
water worth mentioning is in Utah, that lake
being salt and below the level of the ocean.</p>

<p>While the subject of this chapter is introduced
under the heading of springs, it may seem out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
of place to bring in these great lakes, assuming
that they are of the same class. But there is
no doubt whatever of their being nothing more
or less than mammoth springs.</p>

<p>Next to the great lake system of the world,
may be called in evidence the atolls so prevalent
in the southern Pacific Ocean and growing
also in other places on the globe. These peculiar
features appear to have been built up from the
tops of submarine mountains or old craters that
have been filled with fresh water, from which
structures of coral have grown till they reached
the surface. The formation of these atolls being
generally elongated, or in chains like mountain
ranges, is suggestive of the same influence in
their inception as the upheaval of mountain
chains on land surfaces by hydraulic pressure.</p>

<p>This may be a good place to ask where the
fresh water supply comes from to produce these
atolls. That they are produced by fresh water
there can be no question, as the work of coral is
never performed without an abundance of this
element to build through. That the bottom of
the ocean has many subterranean rivers nobody
will dispute. That nearly every island in the
ocean has springs of fresh water, none can deny.
Where does it come from? Many of these
islands have thermal springs, like Iceland with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
its geysers of many varieties. Some with common
fresh water, and nearby springs of mineral
water. One familiar to this region is Block
Island with both fresh water and mineral
springs, and little lakes on the high ground alive
with fresh water fish. Are they supplied with
rain water?</p>

<p>Mount Desert is a very good witness to call.
Here is an island eighteen miles in diameter
surrounded by salt water with an elevation of
1,800 feet, and 1,200 feet above the ocean are
three fine lakes, Eagle Lake, Crooked Lake, and
Echo Lake. In which lakes are trout weighing
eight or ten pounds. On this small island are
to be found thousands of springs pouring out
from every crack and crevice. The water is pure
and clear as in all such cases. Where does it
come from? No more generous gift to man and
all animated nature, has been bestowed by Providence
than the universal distribution of springs
all over the world.</p>

<p>Within twenty rods of the top of Mount
Washington, the highest peak in the New England
States, flows out a copious spring of water.
The whole mountain system is full of springs
and lakes. The entire Adirondack region is in
the same condition. It is safe to leave it to the
reader who has ever been out of sight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
smoke of his own chimney to think of the abundance
of instances where he has seen lakes and
springs on the tops of high hills, where no shed
water to any extent could reach them, and wonder
how they came there.</p>

<p>To assume that rains sink into the ground
and form water supplies, seems incredible when
the experience of any man who has ever dug a
well or sunk a shaft in a mountain, or tunneled
under a hill ought to disprove such an idea at
once. As we dig down we always meet water,
and the deeper we get the more we find. Where
does the water from the surface turn around to
come back? Some of the water coming up is
salt, some fresh, some hot, but mostly of a uniform
coolness of about fifty degrees.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">X.<br />


GLACIERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>We hear a great deal said about the age of
Glaciers. This is assuming that the Earth has
at some time been in a condition to be almost
uninhabitable, as evidences of this Glacial influence
seem to be reported from all parts of the
globe.</p>

<p>As the theory of a warmer climate having existed
in primeval times and that the Earth is
and has been for ages cooling off hardly leaves
a place for a universal period of Glaciers.</p>

<p>It hardly seems rational that the vast accumulation
of flora to produce the coal deposits and
sustain the wonderful specimens of animal and
reptile growth could have been interrupted by
a period of ice. If so, the earth in its present
condition shows evidence of growing warmer instead
of cooling off.</p>

<p>It is by the writer seriously doubted that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
many evidences attributed to glaciers can be
charged to their influence.</p>

<p>Where large rocks are found foreign to anything
in their immediate surroundings and similar
to formations at quite long distances away,
the explanation that the straggling specimens
were carried there by glaciers is not necessarily
conclusive.</p>

<p>There may be many instances where such evidences
are the work of glaciers, but it does not
seem as if an ice age were needful to produce
the changes of rock, or to show the markings
on rocks claimed to have been caused by glacial
abrasions. Icebergs can produce and explain
every such feature as is claimed for the glacier,
and there seems to be little reason to doubt that
similar evidences such as are imputed to glaciers
are constantly going on as much at the present
day as in any remote age in the past.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that icebergs have existed
in all time from the earliest movement of
the Earth’s machinery.</p>

<p>As explained in treating of icebergs, an area
of extent equal to some of our smaller States
frozen to a depth of thousands of feet breaks up
and floats away from the polar oceans. Presuming
an iceberg large as the State of Rhode
Island to start off, which is very likely a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
estimate of the size of many, such berg being
exposed to thawing winds and the sun’s rays
until thousands of miles away from its starting
point, and after all these exposures is often a
mass of 300 or more feet high and 2,000 feet
deep. Imagine the weight and force of such a
body striking the peak of some submarine mountain,
the top of a hill with the momentum produced
by wind and tide. There tops could as
easily be wiped off and carried long distances,
as a man can strike off the top of a measure of
grain, and leave the same marks attributed to
glaciers.</p>

<p>These great masses of rock and soil supposed
to be transferred from their original deposit are
carried long distances till melting has loosened
a hold, and they are dropped to the bottom of
the ocean and left for the wonderment and surmise
of the future as to how they got there. This
process of wiping off high points of submarine
lands must be going on just as much at the
present time as ever in the past, and seems a
very wise and cheap system of dredging instituted
by Providence.</p>

<p>With the reasoning to follow of how the Earth
obtains and maintains its warmth an ice age
would seem an impossibility and absurdity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>


<h3>WHAT PRODUCES A GLACIER?</h3>

<p>Here again the influence of Springs is called
into service. As all the hills and mountains, it
is here claimed, are the results of water aided by
centrifugal force, therefore the hills and mountains
become the reservoirs of supply for all the
lower parts of the Earth. This arrangement of
Nature provided the means for producing a Glacier.
At high altitudes in the mountains, whether
in the frigid zone or in the temperate, break forth
springs; coursing down the mountain side to
the valleys, the waters soon become aërated so
as to freeze. Springs from different ranges
and neighboring heights contribute their streams,
all commingling in the deep cañons and freezing
in a mass. With the accumulations of snow and
rain, this body grows until in time, by the constant
supply from the springs, rain and snow,
the mountain gorges are filled however wide and
large they may be.</p>

<p>This monstrous aggregation of ice must of
course seek a lower point by its enormous weight
and constant accumulation on top, and naturally
begins to crawl down the valley grade. The first
inception of a glacier is spring water, which with
other contributions named ultimately produces
what may be called a river of ice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Under the ice river is always flowing a stream
of water, and many air holes and openings are
found upon the surface at different points, no
doubt produced by the influence of spring water
coming in of temperature above freezing or at
the usual fifty-two degrees, about the average
of fresh water springs in all latitudes. This conglomeration
of influences to make a glacier shows
the absurdity of having such solid masses break
off, as claimed to be seen by Arctic explorers,
large enough to remain intact well down into
the Atlantic Ocean. As these mountain ravines
fill up, of course the waters involve and cover
with ice, every rock and tree, and all such objects
in the way must necessarily be carried to
some lower point and ultimately left. This
faculty of a glacier has given it credit for performing
all such apparent transitions, while icebergs
which evidently do 1,000 times this amount
of work are getting much the smaller share of
credit.</p>

<p>It has been reported by sailors in the region
of icebergs that by observations taken during a
few months, they perceptibly grow many feet
higher, which goes to prove the claim that they
are constantly being added to from underneath.
With change of season, these monsters
are floated away from their moorings, toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the Equator to cool and freshen the main oceans,
produce electric currents of air, become the wonder
and terror of ocean travel, and melting away
under tropical suns; or on the other hand, some
may seek the interior and contribute themselves
to the cooling of the waters that manifest themselves
in refreshing springs all over the Earth.</p>

<p>There were newspaper reports of large
masses of ice being thrown out during the great
eruption in the Island of Java, but such statements
may do better for newspaper items than
to sustain an argument in this work. How can
this equable condition of spring water, with its
delicious coolness adjusted to all seasons and
tastes, be accounted for if it does not come practically
from one common source? Will some
scientist answer?</p>

CAVES.</h2>
</div>

<p>These peculiar freaks in the Earth are nothing
to excite much curiosity or wonder. It is rare
to find caves only in limestone formations which
by long contact with water gradually wash away
and leave monstrous chambers that have formerly
been a solid mass.</p>

<p>Sometimes a cave may be formed by a sinking
of the floor, leaving the arched top supporting
itself, but whatever the cause and wherever
caves are found, I never read of any but lead to
subterranean rivers of great purity and coolness
of water, nearly all the waters of which are
credited with blind fish. Where did the fish
originate? The stalagmites and stalactites tell
of the copious influence of water.</p>

<p>What is the source of these cave rivers? Are
they from soakage of rainfalls and do they have
any dry season?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII.<br />


ARTESIAN WELLS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Here is a subject that is worthy the attention
of settlers in our arid and apparently desert
regions of country. We are told that the source
of an artesian well is from fountains of water
gathered and stored in higher lands that run
through different strata of rocks till they reach
the valleys, and when the boring reaches down
to these strata the water naturally comes up
toward the height of the fountain it started
from. Would it not be a sensible inquiry to
make as to where the supply came from to furnish
the water in the higher lands? That the
accepted theory of supply to artesian wells comes
from some higher point is not correct can be demonstrated
on the prairies, where no higher land is
in sight.</p>

<p>A very good test occurred some years ago at
the Hamilton mine, adjoining the great Chapin
mine, in Wisconsin. It became almost impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to work the mine on account of the great influx of
water.</p>

<p>Not much more than a half mile away was a
lake that was charged with producing this annoying
flow.</p>

<p>At the time of a temporary abandonment, the
writer disputed this solution, and a survey was
proposed to determine the level in the lake and
mine, which showed the water in the mine eleven
feet the lowest. To overcome this encroachment
of water, an ingenious device was adopted by
building a chimney over the point of inflow to
the height of water level and stopping at the
bottom; when completed allowed to fill.</p>

<p>When its true level was reached the rest of
the mine was dry some distance above. It is
doubtful if any place on the Earth will not respond
with a flow of water within a mile in depth
and rarely half that distance will need to be
bored.</p>

<p>In the Mojave desert it is claimed a depth of
200 feet and often less gets a good flow of
water. What sends it up and whence its source?
In Michigan, Wisconsin, and many other adjacent
States, a depth of 100 or 200 feet will produce
large flowing wells. Where does this universal
supply come from and why unchanged by
wet or dry seasons? The flow from Lake Superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>

August than in the wet season of spring.</p>

<p>If there is no unfailing supply of water in the
Earth, where does the influence come from to
produce an Oasis in a desert?</p>

<p>If artesian wells are bored in our arid and
now almost worthless lands, wherever a fountain
of water is tapped will be an Oasis around which
the settler can produce fabulous wealth of crops
and obtain forage for live stock. The expense
of boring wells will be largely compensated by
cheapness of land and bountiful results in vegetation.</p>

OASES.</h2>
</div>

<p>These green spots in the great deserts are the
counterparts of Islands in the oceans.</p>

<p>If not thrown up and fed by water upheaval,
how are they produced? Are they volcanic?
The Oasis of Ammonium, or Siwah, six miles
long and eight wide, contains the ruins of the famous
temple and oracle of Ammon, visited by
Alexander the Great, and celebrated for the fountain
of the Sun, whose waters are warm at morning
and evening, and cold at noon.</p>

<p>There are several oases not long distances west
of the Nile in the Great Desert. The ancients
considered them as Islands in a Sea of Sand, but
they are really elevated lakes, although not manifesting
themselves much at the surface, but underlying
so closely as to render the climate too
unhealthy to live in during the summer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
autumn, being of a swampy character, and yet
very productive in winter and spring. Where
do these waters soak in to produce such spots in
the deserts?</p>

THINGS THAT PUZZLE US.</h2>
</div>

<p>It is frequently a query how the distribution
of fish is so general even in the most obscure
lakes and springs rising and running from points
so isolated as to apparently preclude such specimens
from getting there. It seems strange that
some species would exist at the head of a stream
and not inhabit it throughout. Seas and lakes
may, and do exist, without any visible outlets to
the ocean, and yet are plentifully supplied with
varieties of fish. Now what may be a rational
explanation of how they got there. It cannot
seem right to say that they originally existed in
an adjacent sea or the nearest approach to the
ocean, as they are not found in any adjacent
waters and are entirely peculiar to their locality,
having no neighbors akin. It does not seem as
if such would be the case if they became isolated
by some remote upheaval and change of surrounding
Earth’s surface, as this would only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
divide up the family and spread the species like
immigration from the eastern to the western
states.</p>

<p>As asked before, where do these blind fish
come from in caves where streams do not seem
to have any connection with surface waters?
Where do the many specimens come from in the
island lakes all over the world? To all these
questions there seems a simple answer when we
accept the idea that the center of the Earth is
the womb that is developing and sending out
through every pore, seam, crevice and crack
some new seed and form of life to develop a
new and strange existence to us on the outside.</p>

<p>It is a Scriptural idea that “We are born of
water.”</p>

<p>Creatures that have their inception in the
bowels of the Earth cast their eggs as the fish
and reptile spawn in our rivers. These eggs or
spawn or seeds of life in whatever form are
taken in the currents that course through the different
strata of the earth by centrifugal force
and pressure, taking almost any amount of time
in their hermetically sealed transit before they
reach an atmosphere in which to develop into a
new existence. Any lake, spring, or fountain
of water that is a living stream fed by the inexhaustible
sources within, may have from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
varied storehouse and laboratory of nature any
specimen of fish, scale, skin, shell or reptile of
any form, that no adjoining or neighboring water
may develop.</p>

<p>The spawn or egg may be destroyed on its
outward passage or held back by influences preventing
its maturity; or landed on the surface
under unfavorable conditions of climate, air, and
properties in the water.</p>

<p>Why do shad not exist anywhere in similar
coast waters? Where do they come from and is
the Gulf Stream to be credited with their origin?
Where do the different schools of blue fish,
mackerel, herring and numerous other fish find
their headquarters to breed, and why after seeking
other waters for a season, return to some
place that seems to be their “sweet home”?</p>

<p>Was Seth Green the pioneer in transportation
of spawn to distant waters for their incubation?
It is more than likely that he was not;
with all credit due to the great service his genius
has rendered.</p>

<p>What is said of the dissemination of fish,
shells, and reptiles may be consistently said of
vegetation.</p>

<p>The earth is filled with the seed of every plant
and tree and shrub that ever sprang into life in
any place, clime or time. Dig to whatever depth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
you will, the substance you throw out, whether
earth or stone, when exposed to the air, will
produce some growth of vegetation. Frequently
something entirely new and different from the
surrounding vegetation. To assume that streams,
winds, and birds carry and distribute all the
seeds to their different localities where found in
an isolated condition, is too much for human
credulity. On the tops of mountains, where
streams do not run uphill on the surface, where
the birds seldom fly, and on spaces impossible
for seeds to be carried by winds, you find species
peculiar to their altitude, atmosphere and soil.</p>

<p>Through the channels that eternally pour from
never ending supplies, and in which storehouse
are mingled the seeds from every valley, plain
and mountain top of our Earth; from this source
they can be scattered and mixed in every inch
of the soil which composes our Earth from center
to surface, and when brought into contact
with our atmosphere start into new and varied
existences.</p>

<p>The question may be reasonably asked if many
of the reptilian specimens attributed to remote
antiquity as belonging to our Earth’s surface,
may not be specimens from an interior world,
and even now have representatives of their existence
there?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Certain plants and growths require specific
treatment and conditions. Wherever pond lilies,
peppermint, cattails, flag-root, cresses, and moss
in wells are found is unfailing proof of living
fountains of water.</p>

<p>The ocean furnishes every facility of transportation
through the co-operative system without
and within. The millions of seed that mature
in different climes on the surface are
dropped and carried by floods and currents into
the main ocean. Some sink and lie buried for
ages, retaining their germs of life, for the outer
ocean has its regular currents and motions to
such an extent, it would not make a general distribution
of seed in countless years.</p>

<p>Through this avenue passing under the ice
belt, every variety is more or less drawn into this
general receptacle which, in turn carries them
inward and outward, and in course of time filters
them in their course into every inch of the
earth through which the water passes; which is
in this way the medium of transportation.</p>

<p>By this means every spoonful of earth is in
time prepared to give growth of new life to any
plant or tree that has ever existed when exposed
to the influence of air and heat or even
cold, to revive its species.</p>

<p>In passing to the surface, like the spawn of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
fish, they may pass through localities of such
excessive heat as to destroy their life germs, as
is undoubtedly the case with the spawn that
should travel through waters like geysers of Iceland
or the Yellowstone Park or waters similar
to these, whose streams that flow away always
show a dearth of fish.</p>

<p>With the Earth formed like this, the writer
claims it to be on the principle of a globe for a
gas jet, open on both sides and presenting as it
turns inward a funnel shaped entrance, which
is without doubt over 1,500 miles across; this
passage would be just as vast to the eye as the
size of, or distance to, the fixed stars, the eye
losing all conception of measure, and a thousand
miles is just as much beyond our scope of
vision as a million.</p>

<p>In almost any position you can imagine the
Earth to revolve around the Sun, one of these
sides or ends must be partially and at times
wholly exposed to the Sun’s rays, and the effect,
it seems natural to suppose, would make the
interior horizons light as the exterior. The
water, it is believed, on any body acts as a reflector
and is a giver of light from every planetary
body in some degree.</p>

<p>It is all gas, to talk about the gaseous condition
and nature of the Sun, and “other worlds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
than ours.” They would at best be a very poor
investment and not worth the labor and genius
of a power able to create; 160 acres of good land
in any productive locality would be worth more
than 1,000 such whirling pyrotechnics of space.</p>

<p>It is altogether too presumptive to suppose
that our little Earth with all its boasted cities,
and boroughs thrown in, can be the only habitation
for poor, vain and sinful man.</p>

METEORS.</h2>
</div>

<p>These are nothing more or less than dust
particles thrown from volcanic eruptions on
some planet, and in countless numbers drifting
through time and space till sucked into the atmosphere
of some other orb.</p>

<p>Whoever doubts the influence of friction
ought to be convinced by watching these meteoric
specks falling through our atmosphere of
a clear evening, although the process goes on
as much in day as night time.</p>

<p>While falling in space this dust must gain
an inconceivable speed, as a feather without resistance
falls as rapidly as a ball of lead.</p>

<p>The contact with our atmosphere ignites and
evidently consumes them into gas before reaching
the Earth. They used to be called falling
stars, but if they were of inferior magnitude it
is quite probable there would have been many a
badly bumped head before this time, from the
numbers that have fallen.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI.<br />


ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION.</h2>
</div>

<p>This seems to be a question not fully settled
by sufficient authority. It seems as if this term
were incorrectly applied and that suction would
be a better name for the agency.</p>

<p>That bodies fall to the ground when dropped,
or return when thrown or shot into the air is
nothing more than a stick of wood thrown into
a stream floats with the current and drifts to
the bank.</p>

<p>Most people when asked which side of a fan
you feel the air from, when fanning yourself,
naturally reply from the side toward you, but
by trying the experiment you will soon discover
that the air comes after the passage of the fan,
only filling the space or vacuum the fan has
made.</p>

<p>It has often been asked why people trying to
board a train in motion are so apt to be drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
under the wheels, and legs and arms crushed. It
is the same reason as with the fan, a large
vacuum is being produced and proportionate suction
occurs to fill it.</p>

<p>A man can stand alongside a train when motionless
and lean against it, or put his hand on
it, as safely as on the depot, but when in motion
of thirty or forty miles an hour, it would be
almost sure to cost him his life. Attraction can
hardly be possible except by affinity; iron can
be attracted by a magnet no more than wood,
unless possessed of that peculiar quality of being
magnetic. Mr. Edison’s experiments have to be
confined entirely to such bodies of ore.</p>

<p>That attraction of affinity exists there can be
no doubt, as exhibited in plants, insects, birds
and animals, both quadruped and biped, otherwise
courtship and marriage and all means of
propagating species would be for naught and
neglected.</p>

<p>It is a general supposition that we derive our
heat from the Sun by direct rays, but it is doubtful
if it comes only through its innumerable rays
of light through which the Earth and the planets
revolve, and here friction puts in one of its
special works. The common idea that noon-day
is the time for the greatest heat is not always
justified, for other influences, such as friction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
in the atmosphere, can make midnight
warmer than noon.</p>

<p>The concentrated rays of the Sun at midday
of course bring them so closely together, and
direct, that the Earth’s revolution comes squarely
across them, as can be demonstrated across the
teeth of a comb, thus showing a greater pressure
than drawn obliquely.</p>

<p>That heat can come directly from the Sun
seems an impossibility without some medium of
contact, which through the coldness and a barrenness
of space does not seem to exist.</p>

<p>As we arrive at certain altitudes in the mountains,
we find perpetual snow and ice, and the
same class of atmosphere is encountered anywhere
else rising in a balloon to similar heights.
It would be natural to expect an increasing
warmth as we get away from the Earth toward
the Sun, but the reverse being the case, it is
hard to imagine what the temperature of space
1,000 miles away must be.</p>

<p>The question is likely to be asked, if the Sun
does not send out heat, how is it obtained?</p>

<p>The answer will be in accordance with the
first proposition in this brief work. All heat is
obtained by Friction, in absence of which there
can be no heat. The Earth gets its heat mostly
by friction through its atmosphere.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>The mass of atmosphere surrounding our
planet is like an ocean made up of gases and
elements that produce both water and land. The
revolution of the Earth through that atmosphere
at the rate of 1,000 miles an hour, seventeen
miles a minute, or nearly four miles every second,
is something as incomprehensible to our
minds as the distance to the Sun. Only for this
friction for a certain distance from the surface,
the same condition of cold would no doubt exist
on the surface as on the tops of the high ranges
of mountains.</p>

<p>The Earth is producing its own warmth by
friction in its atmosphere the same as a wagon-wheel
would do by being rapidly revolved inside
of a loose tire. The atmosphere is virtually a
tire surrounding us, through which the Earth
revolves, and by Friction produces the warmth
as really as a man warms his hands by rubbing
them together.</p>

<p>That the Sun can be an inconsumable body of
fire, or that it can become extinct is a most preposterous
belief.</p>

<p>That the Sun is a vast body of earth and water
hardly admits of a doubt, and its warmth and
light is due to the same influence largely that
the Earth and every other planet experiences.</p>

<p>There is not and cannot be a complete consumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
of material in the immutable affairs of
Nature, as there must be an eternal and exhaustless
interchange of supply and demand. While
our forest and other fuel supply is being burned,
another is growing and something forming to
keep up the balance.</p>

<p>In Nature nothing is lost, neither can there be
increase; design is limitless, and resources inexhaustible;
duplicates are never known in form,
species, features, and thoughts; thus showing
one of Nature’s most positive laws, that mankind
shall not accept one central thought, creed,
or purpose to be universally followed, as such
an order of things would entirely preclude the
writing of the few hints herein offered, as the
encouragement of any new device for man’s
benefit of body or mind, thus leaving everything
in a state of stagnation wherein thrift, learning,
and progress would be unknown.</p>

<p>Nature never repeats her works, and no two
grains of sand or flakes of snow have ever been
exactly alike, or ever motionless. Motion causes
friction. Friction produces heat. Heat produces
life.</p>

SCIENTIFIC THEORIES.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Mediterranean Sea, a body of water between
Europe and Africa, nearly 2,000 miles in
length, surrounded with most of the noted cities
of antiquity, has remained during these thousands
of years in an unchanged condition from
tides, inundations, or any other disturbing
causes. Into this sea through the Strait of Gibraltar
has been flowing all this time from the
Atlantic Ocean, a river 15 miles wide with an
average depth of one and one-fourth miles. This
river is reported to have so strong a current that
a sailing vessel has difficulty of coming out
against it without the help of a favorable east
wind. This is a sufficient flow of water to fill
the basin of the sea almost yearly, besides the help
of all the rivers of Southern Europe and Northern
Africa. The reason of no change is given for
its location, where evaporation carries off all this
influx of water; while some think an undercurrent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
must exist back into the Atlantic. The first
reason seems too ridiculous for a child to give.
The water of the Atlantic is so salt as to produce
over a pound of salt to a common bucket
full. If evaporation is the reason of its equable
condition, there could be no other result than a
mountain of salt big as the Himalayas long before
this time.</p>

<p>The claim of a countercurrent is almost as
absurd. That the sea discharges its waters in
an undercurrent which passes through the neighborhood
of the Caspian and Aral Seas, is more
likely than that the waters run backward against
a powerful current from the Atlantic and against
the centrifugal force that governs the movements
of relatively every other water course on
the Earth.</p>

<p>So much for that subject for any criticisms
that may be offered. Intervening lakes between
the Caspian and Aral Seas, seasonably fill with
salt water, from the evaporation of which immense
bodies of salt are gathered. Where does
this supply of salt water come from to leave
hundreds of thousands of tons of salt each year?</p>

SURFACE INFLUENCES OF WATER,
AND CHANGE OF POLARITY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Very little thought or attention is paid to the
insidious changes produced by water on the
Earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Not a day passes, or has gone by, but that a
large quantity of material is transferred from
one locality to another. Every shower carries
from some higher point to a lower, and a certain
amount of drift goes toward some ocean.
Small streams contribute to the larger ones, and
all lead to the great ocean reservoirs. In going
across our country many important evidences are
to be seen of the immensity of work accomplished
by water, in the removal of vast areas and
depths of land.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable and apparent seen
by the writer is in the valley of the Rio Grande,
in passing through New Mexico and at some
other points. For more than 100 miles through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
this valley in the spring and summer you seem
to be following an ordinary creek that gives
little idea of the importance attached to such a
stream as the Rio del Norte. You see a stream,
only thirty or forty feet wide, with steep, abrupt
banks, of a sort of adobe soil, some six to ten
feet high.</p>

<p>At various places, if you observe, in the bends
of the stream these perpendicular banks of earth
will be caved off into the water, at frequent intervals.
When the next annual freshet comes this
loosened earth is carried away toward the Gulf
of Mexico, and portions of it reach there while
other parts will be lodged at different points on
the way.</p>

<p>Now this visible, and natural process, has been
going on for ages, and the effect of this incessant
work and stupendous result is to be seen far as the
eye can reach for hundred of miles.</p>

<p>Here follow the proofs of this long and diligent
labor. In all directions you see hills, or immense
mounds of land, like inverted deep pans, with
flat bottoms, of all sizes, so that their flat tops
would include from one acre to hundreds. These
mounds all have quite precipitous sides, subject to
the wash of every rainy season. As you study
the character of these high mounds you will soon
be convinced they are not upheavals, as their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
tops in all directions seem to have a common
level. Among these mounds will be occasional
ones that have been washed away to a point, and
here and there one reduced to half its original
height. These hill-tops, if they may be so called,
were beyond doubt, at some very remote time
in the past, the common level of the country for
hundreds of miles, and as they will average 100
feet high or more, it is beyond the power of conjecture
to estimate the time required to wash
all the vast area away that once existed to make
up the level of this valley.</p>

<p>Another similar exhibition is at and near
River Falls, in Wisconsin, a town on the east
bank of the Mississippi, some thirty miles east
of St. Paul. Here the same occurrence seems
to have taken place, of a washing away of the
greatest bulk of the land, and leaving similar
mounds with their flat tops, on many of which
are quite extensive farms, approached by very
precipitous roads at some favorable point on
their sides. These mounds seem to have different
strata of soft rock, on which they stand, the
lowest and thickest of gray sandstone, quite
soft, and must, with the others, be gradually wasting
away by frosts, and other agencies to disintegrate.
Only one yellowish stratum is strong
enough to be used for some building purposes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>While there are hundreds of these mounds that
must have once been the level of the whole country,
that which is now left is a very level and
fertile soil, producing some of the finest wheat,
and best quality of potatoes in the State.</p>

<p>These instances are only two out of thousands
of a similar nature in this country and all over
the world.</p>

<p>The tendency of this drift is mostly as the
streams of water run toward the Equator or
center of greatest motion.</p>

<p>The vast deserts and other accumulations of
sand on the Earth are only the deposits of ancient
rivers into then existing seas, which by later
surface upheavals, by interior hydraulic forces,
have been transferred to other beds, and the deserts
like Sahara, Atacama, Mojave, and the
Steppes of Asiatic Tartary, remain as evidences.</p>

<p>By these enormous changes of soil it seems
rational to believe the uniform and unvarying
revolution of the Earth could hardly be possible,
and that more or less change during great length
of years must be made in form as well as time of
revolving. Have not both occurred? Riding
down the Quinnipiac Valley to New Haven,
Conn., a man is likely to inquire in his mind
where those sand plains came from. Some think
the Connecticut once flowed there, some the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
Niagara or St. Lawrence; if so, where did they
bring the sand from?</p>

<p>Think of the change bound to come in the future,
when the Falls of Niagara cut their way
back to Lake Erie, thus letting out its waters,
enough to construct it into a large river.</p>

<p>Some channel has evidently been lowered to
settle the surface of Lake Michigan, as can be
plainly seen in leaving Chicago by boat, that the
waters on the western banks were once twenty
or more feet above present level. Either the lake
has settled or the land has risen. As deserts are
nearly all below the ocean surface, is it not presumable
that this enormous accumulation of sand
has had the effect of such depression, while the
transference from other localities has thinned
Earth’s crust enough to make easy the internal
water pressure to lift up the hills and mountains,
through which the great water courses of the
Earth are supplied? Think of the transportation
of soil to the deltas of the Mississippi, Amazon,
Ganges and other rivers amounting to millions
and millions of tons every year, and imagine
when the time will come when the Earth approaches
the form of a wheel, or ring, nearer than
a globe, and become a small imitation of Saturn.</p>

<p>Assuming that this is, and has been one cause
of the great upheavals, is it not suggestive that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the original of the Earth’s surface in its formation
millions of years past, was nearly or quite
free from hills, and mountains, and the inside as
well as exterior has been undergoing radical
changes?</p>

<p>Great masses of earth on the outside accumulated
by floods and washed from higher points
have dammed up and smothered the flow from
inside, while the sections of the Earth that have
contributed to this mass have been thrown up
into exterior mountains, and the depressions made
inheavals to a corresponding extent.</p>

<p>From this reasoning it might appear why Africa
and Australia, with their vast area of deserts,
are less supplied with rivers and lakes proportionally
to other continents; the same deficiency
of mountains being noticeable. On the other hand,
the rest of the continents and islands abound
in mountains, lakes, springs and rivers. The
great present groups of Islands of Oceanica, will,
perhaps, in the distant future, all be joined to one
mass, and while they may rise higher, others in
present use may sink.</p>

<p>The legend of Atlantis may be repeated in some
coming age, and perhaps a new Bible story will
record the seagoing experience of another Noah;
but if so, it is hoped he will have a bigger
ship, and better provided with modern improvements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
and other sanitary arrangements than the
old boat seemed to be for so long and important
a voyage. From what has been written on surface
influence of water is it not reasonable that
polar variations must have occurred through the
millions of years Mother Earth has been whirling
through space? The writer does not assume to
know all claimed in this discussion, being an
agnostic in this as well as in spiritual knowledge;
but if some full-grown scientific giant will
rise up and give any more plausible reasons for
why things are as they are, I shall be delighted
to sit on some little stool and let him thrust the
information into my bewildered cranium.</p>

CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p>The author of this unscientific work has assumed
the task to contradict theories that to him
have seemed wrong, although long accepted from
scientific authorities.</p>

<p>The world is given to taking statements for
granted that emanate from some professional
man’s brain, and published in some newspaper
or book, whether of real or fictitious origin.</p>

<p>The stories of Wm. Tell, Robinson Crusoe,
Washington and his little hatchet, Jack the Giant
Killer, Samson and the foxes, Joseph sold into
Egypt, St. Patrick’s extermination of toads and
snakes, Newton’s discovering the “law of gravitation”
by an apple dropping on his head, Noah’s
flood, etc.—all of these and hundreds more have
passed for current facts by being oft told. Plain
stories and simple unadorned tales have small
circulation without lies enough mixed in to make
them interesting.</p>

<p>Every age has its learned prodigies and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
scientific minds that are ready to answer any
question and solve all obscure matters. When
men of early ages discovered on hills and mountains
marine shells and other deposits which
showed evidence of the bottom of a sea or ocean,
and fossil deposits and footprints in rocks, they
naturally inquired of the wise men how they
came there. Hence quite likely the story of the
flood.</p>

<p>When they asked how the people of Europe
were white, Asia, yellow, and Africa, black,
the solution was, that Noah had three sons who
settled, one in each country and produced such
progeny. The geography of the world in those
early times represented the Earth as having
four corners, and surface flat with “jumping
off” places on all sides. It is evident the solvers
of this “race problem” had no knowledge of
America and Australasia. (Time has developed
the fact that they either knew about it and lied, or
lost sight of two sons that Noah should have had
to represent the red and brown races.) It is
expected of us to believe that Japheth was white,
and peopled Europe; Shem yellow, and settled
down to farming in Asia, and Ham black, and
went into the monkey and elephant business in
Africa. Whether the two other boys, the brown
one, that raised Malays, and the red one, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
bred and introduced the American Indian, were
ever married, I never learned, but conclude it
was unnecessary, as they seemed to have as good
success in settling up their respective countries as
the favorite boys that Noah took, with other live
stock, on his yachting trip.</p>

<p>Noah should have really been the man to write
on the subject about which this paper treats, as
his experience on the “cold-water” question must
have given him superior advantages over the
writer.</p>

<p>There have been conscientious men of all times
who have said and done very silly and unwise
things, which, at the time and in the age they
were enacted, were considered by public and private
consent right and just.</p>

<p>The hanging of witches, buying and selling of
slaves, the burning of John Rogers at the stake,
his wife and nine small children, one at the breast,
as spectators, were considered as just and necessary
as an act put in force to destroy crows and
kill sheep dogs.</p>

<p>As age succeeds age, new ideas crop out, and
what to a former generation appeared true and
consistent to their successors oft become a subject
of criticism and ridicule. It is to be hoped
that future minds will take up the subject of this
crude work and make as much advance in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
development of Earth’s mysteries as the modern
steamship excels in completeness and power the
first attempts of Fulton, or the harmonious
modern orchestras the hollow music of a Hindoo
tom-tom.</p>

<p>To believe what is here written will not insure
eternal joys, or to doubt will not incur Divine
wrath, or commit a skeptic into the hands of
him who walketh in darkness, or to an eternity of
pain or woe.</p>

<p>These modest hints are given with the hope
that millions of miles of land on Earth now barren
and useless, by tapping the generous fountains
of water so wisely stored by Providence,
may be turned into gardens of beauty, and furnish
fruits and sustenance in plenty for coming
generations.</p>

<p>While many look upon the Earth as “a vale of
tears,” it is the best world we have any reliable
knowledge of, and seems well adapted to the
wants of animal and vegetable life, if we avail
ourselves of the wise and ample provisions Nature
has put in our way.</p>

<p>If there is another and better world to come,
it is hard to imagine that pearly gates and golden
streets can conduce as much to our comfort, or
will be as goodly a heritage as one of “sweet
fields arrayed in living green,” with shady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
groves, blooming gardens, and generous fountains
of pure sparkling waters, and not the
thirsty abode experienced by Dives.</p>

<p>While on this Earth, Nature has supplied with
prodigality for this life’s wants, land and water,
light and darkness, floods and drouth, and, as
learned from Paul, four kinds of flesh (and he
didn’t say how many kinds of vegetables) reptiles,
insects, worms, bugs, microbes, poison and
its antidotes, good people and bad, heat and cold,
salt and fresh water, scientists, cranks and fools,
yet with all this profusion of gifts, we would be
no better off than Dives in Sheol without the
indispensable blessing of water supplied by
Symmes’s Hole.</p>

<p>A few more questions and done. Why should
sea soundings five miles deep be at temperatures
below freezing, if, as is claimed, such a depth in
land borings would be in a molten condition,
and going much farther the prevailing theory
would make hell an ice house in comparison with
the Laurentian strata?</p>

<p>Where does the fresh water come from admitted
to exist in the bottom of the oceans?</p>

<p>Where is the source of fresh water that
abounds in the highlands of islands in all latitudes?</p>

<p>Where does the water come from that feeds all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
the coral reefs and throws up atolls hundreds of
miles in extent and nourishes the roots of trees
and smaller vegetation?</p>

<p>Why are the atoll inclosures filled with different
varieties of fish from the ocean outside?</p>

<p>Why are most of the great lakes at high elevations
and commonly on top of divides?</p>

<p>Why are springs more numerous all over the
Earth on the hills and mountains than in the
valleys?</p>

<p>Why are the shallowest and most enduring
wells on the highlands instead of the low?</p>

<p>Why when a country is below sea level is it a
desert?</p>

<p>Why did Abraham succeed with his flocks,
while Lot (as he deserved) was dried up and
burnt out? Answer, Abraham was the smarter
of the two, and took to the hills, where he no
doubt had observed the waters lasted.</p>

<p>Where did Moses look for water when his
followers were famishing for it? He went where
water can almost invariably be found, at the foot
of a rocky upheaval which he discovered in
Horeb.</p>

<p>How could water be cast up from a deep artesian
well, bored on a plain with no high land
in sight to produce a pressure claimed in explaining
their nature and reasons why they flow?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Where do all the rivers found in large caves
have their origin?</p>

<p>Where and how does rain water soak into the
ground, turn around and come back again with
the force shown in bubbling springs and artesian
wells?</p>

<p>Why does moss only grow in unfailing wells,
and cresses, peppermint, cattails, and water lilies
in living waters?</p>

<p>Why in digging wells anywhere in striking
gravel do they always find water?</p>

<p>Why do hills and mountains produce more
verdure and forests than the plains?</p>

<p>Why are all the volcanoes extinguished by
water?</p>

<p>These questions can none of them be answered
by any other hypothesis than through a belief in
the existence of Symmes’s Hole. Into such a
hole sufficient water could flow to supply all the
fountains of the Earth, and, what is more, it does
flow, and furnishes the wonderful quantities that
leap down the mountain sides in stupendous
waterfalls, that feed the millions of springs that
pour their sweet influences in rippling streams
through valleys and meadows. It supplies the
great volumes that make Lake Superior and its
grand associates in America, and similar great
lakes throughout the Earth. Last, but far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
least, the phenomenal Gulf Stream that floats the
navies and commerce of the world like toys and
modifies the climate across an ocean. To supply
such resources needs something more than occasional
showers that ordinarily evaporate in forty-eight
hours, or than equinoctial or shearing sheep
storms, of which nine-tenths of their volume runs
into the streams and rapidly to the ocean, the
great and general reservoir of supply and distribution.</p>

<p>Having endeavored to explain the philosophy
of heat and its cause, also other phenomena in
brief, I will conclude by paying tribute to the
great exterior waters, for their important participation
in Nature’s munificent work. The Oceans,
after tossing in the fury of the storms and rocking
from continent to continent, kissed by tropical
winds and frozen by Arctic cold, sunk in caverns,
and dashed upon high rocks, after drinking up
all the rivers, washing every shore, and visiting
every clime, are filtered at the Ice Belt and enter
the bowels of the Earth, to come out again by
centrifugal force in a fresh and renewed form to
contribute to man’s necessities in an even greater
benefit than when rolling in majestic waves or
floating the commerce of the world.</p>

<p>This appendix is added showing cases something
in harmony with the arguments here presented
on all these subjects, to which could be
added several times as many more.</p>

<p>While most of the points intended for a brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
discussion in this book have been hit upon, a few
words, with some newspaper clippings on mysterious
things, are thought best to be added as a
sort of appendix, and of such a character as to
prove of benefit to some readers that see fit to
avail themselves of a few hints to obtain water,
for domestic or irrigating purposes, in an easy
way, and where they would naturally least expect
to find it.</p>

<p>At my old home, on the farm where I was
born, our well, some thirty feet deep, nearly every
season went dry. I have lugged hundreds of
pails of water from neighbors’ wells and from a
spring near the foot of the hill, one-third of a
mile away, during my early life.</p>

<p>The hill is little over a half mile long, and less
than one-fourth a mile wide from its furthest
bases. It is shaped like a box turtle, rising 100
feet or more. There used to be a place near the
top, on the east slope, that looked springy. The
recent owner, a few years ago, dug into this wet
spot, and at a few feet found living water, which
is now piped to his house and barns in plenty.</p>

<p>Some years ago my cousin owned the adjoining
farm on the north end of this hill, and employed
a man to blast out several large iron rocks,
scattered about on the surface of the hill. One
of these rocks, nearly a rod square, lay almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
exactly on the highest part of the hill. This big
rock was full of large cracks, which, in my boyhood,
I took a young visitor to see, explaining
to him that these cracks, no doubt, occurred at
the time of the crucifixion, of which pious information
I was frequently reminded in later
life. This rock was some eight feet deep in the
ground. When the last blocks were hauled out
the space partly filled with clear water, so cold
that it was made available for drinking. Being
in the dryest time of the year, the supply appeared
to be permanent, which induced the laying
of pipes one-third of a mile to barns for
watering stock, which before had to be drawn
mostly from the wells.</p>

<p>A man in the town of Durham—Henry Page—for
years obtained water for his house and stock
by a hydraulic ram; but, getting a new idea, took
advantage of a knoll, shaped like an inverted
bowl, an acre or two in extent, lying across a
field some forty rods from his house. He dug
into the top of this knoll some fifteen feet, striking
plenty of water, which was easily piped all
over his premises in abundant supply. West of
his home rose the Besek Mountain, in a gradual
rise for three-fourths of a mile, where it stopped
in precipitous ledges, on the west side, nearly
200 feet high. I have hunted up to the top of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
these ledges. Near the top of the mountain is
quite a section of swamp, and nearby descending
is a spring that runs a short distance, falling over
a shelving rock, and in two or three rods more
is lost in the loose stones. It is there in the
dryest seasons. Similar to this is a lake on
Talcott Mountain, a short distance from Wadsworth
Tower, and only a few rods from the
abrupt ledges that overlook the towns of Simsbury
and Farmington. Hundreds of such cases
are in evidence all over the country, and it is
quite sure that a large majority of those interested
by reading this book will think of various
similar cases that have been a query in their
minds, “Why they were so.”</p>

<p>While a great number of peculiar features of
this kind can be recorded, I will take time to
relate a case or two farther from home.</p>

<p>My cousin, who took the Scripture lesson of
the rock and its rendings, spent his last days in
Southern California, where springs are rare, and
orange groves and vineyards depend greatly upon
irrigating for water. He was located at Duarte,
about twenty miles east of the city of Los
Angeles, in one of the finest orange and lemon
groves in the State. While they had provisions
for irrigating, the lack of drinking water was
seriously felt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>Visiting at my house some twenty years ago,
where he chiefly made his Eastern home, he
listened to my cranky ideas as set forth in this
work. At first he scoffed, but being a good reasoner,
he afterward thought the idea worth trying,
and promised on his return to experiment
and report, as I had convinced him of several
successes here. In less than a month I got word
from him that “he had struck it.” The grove
lay at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountain, not
one-quarter of a mile away. I advised him to select
some place in the side of the mountain where
the tree growth was greenest, which he did, and
got all the pure water needed.</p>

<p>A Mr. Fitzgerald, owning a large grove about
a mile west, similarly located, took the hint and
obtained quite a favorable result. When visiting
these groves in 1894, almost the first thing Mr.
Fitzgerald wanted to show me was his bountiful
supply of spring water, tapped from the side of
the mountain. These hints and cases are related
as suggestions to any reader who may wish to
better his water supply. Don’t go into the low
ground for it, but tap the hills and high lands,
where all the fountains of the earth are in abundance.</p>

<p>In Southern California three seasons out of
four the plains and valley lands become too dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
for pasturage of cattle and horses and bands of
sheep, and a general hegira is made toward the
mountains. While the Winter rains swell the
streams running to the coast, filling their banks
with rushing waters, by May and June a buggy
can be hauled through every stream from San
Francisco to San Diego without wetting the
hubs of the wheels. The small streams are all
dried up, and water for stock rare to find. As
you go toward the mountains you meet the series
of foothills like inverted bowls, the tops of which
show growth of bulrushes and fleur de lis. At
the foot of the hills will be found some of the
drippings from the streams starting farther back.
As these hills rise in groups, higher and higher
toward the mountains, the green tops show more
and more, and the streams increase in volume,
affording good fishing for trout. Standing on
the tops of these sugar loaf formations in the
grazing season, one is reminded of Abraham’s
herds of cattle on a thousand hills, to be seen as
far as the eye can reach. In southern Minnesota
is a long range of highlands thrown up, which
they term a mountain chain, but scarcely anywhere
is there an upheaval of rocks or any
ledges. Over this range every Spring and Fall
season will be seen thousands of flocks of ducks,
brant, wild geese and sand hill cranes. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
springs do not gush out in streams as from rocky
formations, but ooze up into great mounds, frequently
involving an acre or more, like a great
conical sponge, up the side of which you can
walk, the water gushing out under every footstep,
giving an impression that you may sink
in all the way to the top, where you will find an
open spring several feet across, the water from
which seems to be absorbed by this spongy
mound of earth and vegetation, so that a stream
rarely runs away. This ridge being the highest
land in sight, where does this water come from?
In a country surrounding which, it is necessary
to carry water in kegs for the dogs to drink
when hunting over it.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this work will be made up
of a variety of clippings from newspapers for
several years past, of which these are a small
part. These clippings are published as seeming
mysteries, but which, by the adoption of the
theory promulgated of a hollow earth holding
an ocean of fresh waters, seem easy of solution.
If any other method can be suggested to answer
these puzzling questions, it is to be hoped some
genius will reveal it. If the assertions made
in this book are true, polar expeditions are and
will continue to be as futile as an attempt to
signal the inhabitants of Mars, or to get up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
correspondence with the man in the moon. Not
presuming to exhaust this subject in so brief a
treatise, the field is left open, and large enough
for the thoughts and observations of men of
greater ability to discuss than yours truly.</p>

<h3>IMMENSE FIELDS OF ICE.</h3>

<h4>A STEAMER SURROUNDED AND COMPELLED TO WORK
HER WAY OUT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Montreal</span>, May 22.—The steamer Fremona,
from New Castle, which arrived here yesterday,
had a very startling experience with the
ice about 150 miles on the other side of Cape Ray.
The vessel was steaming slowly through a dense
fog on Wednesday last, when she got right in the
midst of a pack of ice, which was drifting southward
with the Arctic current. After the steamer
had been pounding about in the ice for some
hours the fog lifted and showed the vessel to be
in a dangerous position. All around her were
heavy hummocks of ice, ten feet deep in the water
and showing about a foot above the surface.
Gradually nearing the steamer and crushing the
smaller pieces of ice in their way were a number
of huge icebergs. The captain and chief officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
climbed to the masthead and found that the ice
extended on all sides as far as the eye could see.
There were hundreds of seals on the ice, some of
them being close to the vessel. Two hours were
spent in turning the steamer, and she was then
headed southward and was worked out of the ice.
Owing to the movement of such a large mass of
ice southward it is feared that navigation will be
seriously interfered with.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>News from the whalers in the Antarctic Seas
on February 17 was that up to that time the
whaling had proved a failure, with all the ships
that made the venture. There were plenty of
whales of the finner and humpback kind, but none
of the Greenland kind. Grampuses were too
plentiful. Seals were very numerous, and there
were also plenty of sea lions. Some icebergs of
enormous size were seen; one was fifty miles long
and several were from fifteen to twenty.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>In the Antarctic Ocean the icebergs that have
been noticed from time to time rose 400, 580, 700
and even 1,000 feet above the water, and were
from three to five miles long. Their enormous
bulk may be inferred from the fact that the part
under water is about seven times as large as that
above.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>


<h3>PASSED A GREAT ICEBERG.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">London</span>, Dec. 9.—The British steamship
Galgate reports ice in the South Atlantic. On
September 28, in latitude 49 degrees south, longitude
42 degrees west, the Galgate passed an iceberg
two miles long and 250 feet high. Hundreds
of other icebergs were also seen.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>THREE HUNDRED MILES OF ICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">St. John’s</span>, N. F., Feb. 12.—The British
steamer Dahome, which left Halifax on the 9th
for this port and Liverpool, arrived here to-day.
She reports coming through a field of ice three
hundred miles long. This is something unprecedented
at this season.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>THE GREATEST OCEAN DEPTH.</h3>

<p>The greatest known depth of the ocean is midway
between the Island of Tristan d’Acunha and
the mouth of the Rio de la Plata. The bottom
was there reached at a depth of 40,236 feet, or
eight and three-quarter miles, exceeding by more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
than 17,000 feet the height of Mount Everest, the
loftiest mountain in the world. In the North Atlantic
Ocean, south of Newfoundland, soundings
have been made to a depth of 4,580 fathoms, or
37,480 feet, while depths equaling 34,000 feet, or
six and a half miles, are reported south of the
Bermuda Islands. The average depth of the
Pacific Ocean between Japan and California is
a little over 2,000 fathoms; between Chili and the
Sandwich Islands, 2,500 fathoms; and between
Chili and New Zealand, 1,500 fathoms. The
average depth of all the oceans is from 2,000 to
2,500 fathoms.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Russian reports say that the Sea of Aral has
been steadily rising since 1891. The sea level is
now four feet above that of 1874. The line of
railroad from Orenburg to Tashkend had to be
changed in order to avoid being overflowed. Instead
of sinking three inches a year, as German
geographers had computed, the sea has been rising
at the rate of four inches a year for the last ten
years.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>In 1812 it was La Souffrière, adjacent to the
Morne Garou, which broke loose on the Island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
of St. Vincent, and it is the same Souffrière which
now has devastated the island and is bombarding
Kingston with rocks, lava and ashes.</p>

<p>The old crater of Morne Garou has long been
extinct, and, like the old crater of Mont Pelee,
near St. Pierre, it had far down in its depths,
surrounded by sheer cliffs from 500 to 800 feet
high, a lake.</p>

<p>Glimpses of the lake of Morne Garou were
difficult to get, owing to the thick verdure growing
about the dangerous edges of the precipices,
but those who have seen it describe it as a beautiful
sheet of deep blue water.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>THE SUN’S TEMPERATURE.</h3>

<h3>SAW TREMENDOUS ICEBERGS.</h3>

<h4>THEY ARE 300 FEET HIGH AND SEVEN AND EIGHT
MILES LONG NEAR CAPE HORN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Nov. 20.—French sailing
vessels making port from around Cape Horn
hold the record for sighting huge icebergs. The
French bark Eugenie Fautrel, from Hamburg,
reported that on September 14, near Cape Horn,
a berg seven miles long and 300 feet high was
seen several miles distant on the port bow. Now
comes the French bark Anne De Bretagne, 164
days from Cardiff, and reports that she not only
saw a berg 300 feet high and eight miles long,
but she had to sheer off to keep from wrecking
herself against it.</p>

<p>It was seen on September 3, and after passing
through a great mass of ice, the Bretagne suddenly
came within sight of the giant, harmless
enough in appearance through the soft mist, but
with terribly jagged comers, and a breadth of
front that made the Frenchmen quail.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>


<h3>KINGSTOWN COVERED WITH ASHES.</h3>

<p>It was seen then that the volcano was in
constant eruption, and there was a tremendous
roar. Forked lightning played incessantly over
the disturbed section. The flashes averaged from
sixty to one hundred a minute.</p>

<p>Kingstown, which is twelve miles from the
volcano, was covered with three inches of ashes
and showers of stones on Thursday. The bed of
the old volcano was then a lake three miles across.</p>



<h4>ERUPTION STARTED ON MONDAY.</h4>

<p>The eruption was first observed on Monday.
Huge flames of water shot up, and the people in
that district fled. There has been a continuous
roar ever since.</p>

<p>The northern district, from Chateau Belair to
Georgetown, has been completely destroyed. It
is impossible to proceed beyond that point, on
account of the rivers of lava. A huge hill was
observed where previously there had been a valley.
The whole of that part of the island is
smoking.</p>


<h4>SIXTY KILLED BY LIGHTNING.</h4>

<p>Sixty persons are reported to have been killed
by lightning while getting away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday the island was
showered with ashes. Near Belair the ashes were
three feet deep.</p>

<p>On Thursday there was a continuous shower of
hot sand and water. Everything on the island
was ruined by the ashes.</p>


<h4>SOME PERSONS DYING OF THIRST.</h4>

<p>Many persons were brought in boats from
Kingstown. Some of the refugees who arrived
on the coast were dying of thirst.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>THE NEW JACKSONVILLE.</h3>

<h4>A FRESH CITY BUILT BEFORE THE RUINS OF THE
OLD HAVE CEASED TO SMOULDER.</h4>

<p>Before the fire that destroyed a great part of
the city of Jacksonville, Fla., had ceased to burn,
the city has practically been rebuilt. This statement
not only describes a building operation
remarkable for rapid execution, but also covers
an incident unique in the experience of firemen.</p>

<p>Jacksonville was almost wiped out by fire on
May 3 of last year. An area of 443 acres, comprising
148 blocks, was swept by the flames, and
property worth at least $15,000,000 was destroyed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>The work of rebuilding on a better and more
substantial scale was started within a week and
has since gone on with rapidity unprecedented
in Southern building operations, and now the
city is in far better shape than it was before the
fire.</p>

<p>About three weeks ago the clearing up of the
last of the ruins was begun. The laborers doing
the work removed three or four inches of the
mass of brick and stones on top, and then found,
to their surprise, that underneath the ruins were
still hot.</p>

<p>Smoke began to rise out of the hole they had
dug out, and the farther down they went the
hotter became the ruins, and the thicker the
smoke. At last a mass of red hot coals was
found, which sprang into flame when the air
reached it.</p>

<p>It had been necessary several times within the
year for the fire department to soak this part of
the ruins with water, but it had been thought for
several months that the fire must be out at last.</p>

<p>Alongside new Jacksonville had already sprung
into existence. Six months after the destruction
of the city a new one already covered the greater
part of the site.</p>

<p>Within eleven months more than 2,000 buildings
were erected, fifty of them aggregating in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
cost $2,000,000. And the new Jacksonville is
immeasurably superior to the old.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>A PRAIRIE CAVERN.</h3>

<h4>AN INTERESTING HOLE IN THE GROUND WHERE
CAVES WOULD NOT BE LOOKED FOR.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>From the Oklahoma State Capital.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphur Springs</span>, I. T., Oct. 18.—At a
spot eleven miles southeast of this place, in the
level prairie upland, is an opening about forty
feet in diameter and sixty feet in depth. By
clinging to its rocky and precipitous walls, a
person may descend to the bottom, and there find
the openings to the two caves, one leading westward,
and the other two to the east. For years
this place has been known as Rock Prairie Cave.
It is one of the most striking natural curiosities in
the Chickasaw nation. The caves are of unknown
length, and through one rushes a subterranean
stream of great depth in places and of
icy coldness. Exploring parties have ventured
into these labyrinths for hundreds of yards, but
the danger of becoming lost has prevented a
thorough examination of the underground passages.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>The cave leading westward is easiest of access
and contains a number of spacious chambers.
The room is about seventy feet square and fifty
feet from the floor to the ceiling. The floor is
obstructed with huge boulders. The darkness
and stillness are intense. Picnic parties sometimes
go there, and, with a huge boulder for a
table, eat their lunch in the glare of torches that
cast uncanny shadows along the massive walls.</p>

<p>Timid persons hesitate in venturing into the
depths of the eastern cave. The passage slants
downward at an angle that compels the explorer
to crawl and slip and slide for nearly 100 feet
before reaching a spot where a person may stand
upright and walk safely. From the darkness
echoes the sound of rushing water, which later
is found to be a stream that runs from eight to
thirty feet in width, and from six inches to many
feet in depth. Men have waded in the stream
until the water reached their chins, and then
gone in a boat to points where they were unable
to touch bottom with the longest oars. A farmer
carried his boat into the cave several years ago to
follow the stream to its end. At a depth estimated
to be 200 feet below the surface of the
ground is a natural bridge, formed by a huge
stone that fell across the stream. The water
plunges underneath this bridge like a millrace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
A boat can be pulled over the bridge, however,
and launched on the other side. About 100 feet
below the bridge the stream widens into a broad,
deep pool, with a high, vaulted roof. Beautiful
stalagmites and stalactites adorn this chamber.
Two hundred feet below this pool the passage is
difficult. It is claimed that this cave has been
explored for a mile.</p>

<p>The stream is believed to find its outlet at a
spring about three miles from the entrance to the
caves. This spring is of great size and volume,
and flows with remarkable swiftness. In rainy
seasons the spring boils and gushes as if choked
with the flood of water that pours from its
mouth. The stream in Black Prairie cave
rises when there is a heavy rainfall in the surrounding
country, and the increased flow of both
springs and stream at such times is taken as evidence
that they are connected.</p>

<h3>ARTESIAN WATERS IN TEXAS.</h3>

<p>In the south central part of Texas is an upland
covering an area of 14,000 square miles, and
known as the Edwards Plateau. At the southeastern
foot of this elevated tract there is no end
of gushing springs, which form the headwaters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
of the San Antonio and San Marcos rivers. In
a big State like Texas, the rainfall of one locality
often varies a good deal from that of adjacent
regions. But, according to a bulletin of the
United States Geological Survey, the fluctuations
of discharge of the streams just mentioned correspond
closely to the rainfall up on the plateau,
from which it is inferred that some invisible connection
exists between the springs and the upland.
The bulletin declares that this similarity
has been found to hold true for dry and wet years
alike. The Edwards Plateau is a flat, grass covered
upland. The rain which falls upon it does
not flow off in surface streams, but sinks into the
porous soil, and eventually finds its way underground
to the bold scarp line of the region, where
it bursts out in abundant springs.</p>

<p>The San Antonio River has its source in one
of these artesian springs, and between it and the
wells driven to supply water to the city of San
Antonio there seems to be close connection, shown
in their mutual changes, which indicates that their
waters have a common source. It was recently
noticed that when the wells were steadily drawn
upon for twenty-four hours the water level of
the head lake of the river fell several inches, but
that on shutting off the wells the lake regained
its level in about one day. So intimate is the relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
between the flow of the wells and that of
the river that it is always possible to tell how
high the water will rise in the former by observing
the river’s height on a gauge rod placed upon
its bank.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT ASSAM EARTHQUAKE.</h3>

<p>A thorough report of the earthquake in Assam,
in 1897, the most violent and extended
earthquake of historic times, has been made by
Mr. R. D. Oldham. From an abstract by Prof.
Davis of Harvard University, it appears that an
area of 150,000 square miles was laid in ruins,
all means of communication interrupted, the
hills rent asunder and cast down in the landslips,
the plains fissured and riddled with vents from
which sand and water poured forth in astounding
quantities, causing floods in the rivers, etc.
A surrounding area of 1,750,000 square miles
felt a shock of unusual energy. The earthquake
wave traveled at the rate of 120 miles a minute.
The vertical displacement of the ground near the
center of disturbance was probably as much as
fourteen inches—an unprecedented quantity; the
vertical movement of earthquakes of great violence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
like the Charleston earthquake, is seldom
more than two inches.</p>

<p>Some of the results of this great earthquake
of June 12, 1897, are astonishing. Faults were
produced, one having a throw of 25 feet and a
length of 12 miles; another a throw of 10 feet
and a length of 2½ miles. The larger of the
two dammed a river so as to form a lake several
miles in extent and ruining a forest of at least
50,000 trees. Landslides of great magnitude were
produced in the Himalayas and the valleys of
streams were changed beyond recognition.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>CURIOUS RESULT OF THE EARTHQUAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Indianapolis</span>, Nov. 1.—An interesting point
in connection with the earthquake which was felt
in this city yesterday is the fact that a number
of small Indiana streams having their source in
the southern border of the gas belt have suddenly
filled with water. No rains have occurred in
this State for months to swell the streams, and
in the case of Honey Creek, in the eastern part
of Bartholemew County, it had gone dry several
weeks ago, the water standing only in pools
here and there. This week it is filled to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
brim, and in some places has overflowed. Sugar
Creek, that runs near Edinburg, Johnson
County, was nearly dry, but to-day it is reported
to be nearly filled. Smaller streams rising in
the Hancock County gas territory have shown
similar phenomena. No one can imagine where
the water comes from. In the case of Honey
Creek the records show that previous to the
Charleston earthquake, August 31, 1886, the
stream acted in the same way.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>A VILLAGE DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Constantinople</span>, May 27.—The village of
Repahie in Armenia has been destroyed by an
earthquake. A number of mineral springs
spouted from the crevasses made in the earth
by the shocks and the flow of water was so great
that the adjacent fields were flooded. The earthquake
was preceded by rumblings which caused
the inhabitants to flee from the village and they
thus escaped death from the falling houses. No
lives were lost however.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Since a recent earthquake at Santa Ana, in
Orange County, Cal., the well of Mr. Huntington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
in Los Bolsas district, which for years has
never flowed to any considerable extent, has
given forth large quantities of mud, stones and
other materials, the eruptions being volcanic in
character. The supply of water is now far in
excess of the means provided at the surface
for its care, and it has been found necessary to
ditch from the well to the river to carry it away.
The pipes are at all times in danger of bursting—the
sudden blasts of air and foreign substances
rendering it more or less dangerous to
go near the opening.</p>

<h3>FIRE BANKED FOR YEARS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From the Galveston Daily News.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orange</span>, Tex., Feb. 21.—J. W. Link is filling
in some low lots with ashes and charcoal that
he is hauling from the pit where A. Gilmer at
one time burned the slabs and refuse that came
from his sawmill. The mill was destroyed by
fire Sept. 13, 1899. When the wagons commenced
hauling the mound of ashes was 20 feet
high and nearly 40 feet in diameter at the bottom,
tapering as it went up.</p>

<p>To-day when the men had worked in about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
15 feet, but before they had reached the center
of the heap, the teamsters discovered smoke issuing
from the charcoal as it was being brought
in contact with the air. One of them felt of
his shovel and was startled to find it very hot.
He picked up a piece of charcoal and blew it
with his breath, when it developed into a blaze
of fire. The experiment was repeated several
times to-day and each time the charred lump
would become a live coal. The ashes were about
16 feet thick that stood above the live coals, and
from the outer edge to where the hot ashes were
first discovered, a little above the ground the
fine ashes were fully as thick.</p>

<p>No smoke has been seen to come from the big
ash pile for nearly two and a half years, and
these coals have been in their present resting
place probably for a longer period, as the cone-shaped
mound was much larger when the mill
was destroyed than it was at the time the wagons
commenced removing the ashes.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>The Volcano of Kilauea is very active at present.
The cavity produced by the last breakdown
has not filled up, but there is an active lake
200 to 300 feet below the general level of the
floor and a quarter of a mile in diameter.</p>

<h3>A WHOLE VALLEY LAID IN WASTE.</h3>

<h4>FIFTEEN CRATERS DESTROY WHAT WAS ONCE A
DELIGHTFUL SPOT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lunahuana</span>, United States of Colombia,
March 30, 1891.—This beautiful valley has experienced
a topographical change, and I may
now call a desert that which was formerly a delightful
spot. Fifteen craters have been constantly
at work since Sunday, March 22, throwing
out masses of mud and water which on its
precipitate descent and with the great strength
of the current, is carrying ruin in all directions
and sweeping houses before it, together with their
inhabitants and the cattle, vineyards, farms and
irrigation works.</p>

<p>All the roads north and south of here have
been converted into ditches, through which the
water is continually pouring, and all communication
between Canete and Chincha is interrupted,
while the bridge across the river has been swept
away.</p>

<p>The numerous victims who have suffered, the
deep impression caused by the destruction of all
the irrigation ditches, the fact that it will be impossible
to gather the remainder of the crop of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
grapes, and the certainty that the necessities of
life will reach famine prices, lead me to suggest
that the government should take steps on behalf
of the residents here. Hundreds of families have
been left without homes and are camping out
on the hillsides, the only clothes they have being
those in which they escaped. They are preparing
to cross the ravines, as the floods may
sweep down upon them at any moment.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<p>An interesting geological phenomenon is noticed
in the district of Izium, in Kharkoy, Russia.
In consequence of the heat this summer
the ground broke open in many places and deep
ditches formed, at the bottom of which subterranean
water appeared. Geologists who examined
the ground think that the subterranean water
comes from the same source which supplies the
Slavinskoye salt lakes of the neighborhood.</p>

<h3>A HIVE OF VOLCANOES.</h3>

<h4>OVER THREE THOUSAND ACTIVE VOLCANOES IN
LOWER CALIFORNIA.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">San Diego</span>, Cal., July 25.—The San Diegan
to-day publishes a descriptive account by Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
I. K. Allen, the well-known engineer, of a
phenomena in what is known as the volcano region
of the Cocapah Mountains, situated sixty-five
miles southwest of Yuma in Lower California.
Colonel Allen says there are over three
thousand active volcanoes there, one-half of
which are small cones, ten or twelve feet at
the base, the remaining half five to forty feet at
the base, and fifteen to twenty-five in height.
The whole volcanic region is encrusted with sulphur.
One peculiar feature of the region is a
lake of water jet black, which is a quarter of a
mile in length and an eighth of a mile in width,
seemingly bottomless. The water is hot and salty.</p>

<h3>A TUNNEL A LIME KILN.</h3>

<h4>THE SANTA FE MAY HAVE TO ABANDON ITS JOHNSON
CANYON ROUTE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Los Angeles</span>, Cal., Jan. 31.—The Fairview
tunnel through the mountains at Johnson’s canyon,
near Williams, Ariz., is again on fire and the
officials of the Santa Fe Pacific fear that they
may be compelled to abandon the tunnel, as they
are at a loss to devise means to extinguish the
flames. Investigation shows conclusively that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the new fire was caused by spontaneous combustion.
The tunnel is now nothing but the flue
for an immense lime kiln. The mountain through
which the tunnel passes is chiefly limestone of
a high degree of purity.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>VOLCANIC OUTBURST PROBABLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Cal., July 1.—News from
Susanville, in the Sierra Nevadas, says that
slight earthquake shocks continue and that the
people have been so accustomed to the constant
trembling of the earth that they pay no attention
to it. The shocks, however, have revived
recollections of old settlers who predict volcanic
disturbances in the extinct craters, such as there
were in 1850.</p>

<p>Susanville lies in a highly mountainous walled
valley directly east of Lassen Butte, an extinct
volcano 10,000 feet high. From its summit no
less than forty extinct craters can be seen. Cinder
Cone, which rises 600 feet above the level
of the plateau, was in eruption in 1850. Two
prospectors examined it and found Lake Saltafara,
miles south of Cinder Cone, a center of volcanic
forces. The lake was a mass of boiling
water and mud and from it vast columns of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
flames shot up at intervals. The timber in the
vicinity was on fire. Within the last few years
there has seemed renewed activity in the internal
fires and the present shocks point to the possibility
of another great volcanic outburst which
will find vent through some of the old craters.</p>

<h3>DESOLATED BY ERUPTIONS.</h3>

<h4>FIFTEEN NEW CRATERS DESTROY MANY HOMES AND
RUIN A WIDE AREA IN CHILI.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Panama</span>, April 26.—Regarding the eruptions
in the Lunahuana district of Chili, the Lima
<i>Opinion National</i> has published the following letter
dated March 30:</p>

<p>“This beautiful valley has experienced a topographical

<h3>GLACIER ICE.</h3>

<p>Glacier ice is not like the solid blue ice on
the surface of the water, but consists of granules
joined together by an intricate network of capillary
water, filled fissures. In exposed sections
and upon the surface of the ice can be observed
“veined” or “banded” structure veins of a denser
blue color alternating with those of a lighter
shade containing air bubbles. The cause of this
peculiar structure has been the subject of much
theorizing among investigators, but hitherto the
greatest authorities consider that the explanation
of the phenomenon is yet wanting.—<i>Goldthwaite’s
Geographical Magazine.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>THE LONGEST GLACIER IN THE TEMPERATE
ZONE ASCENDED BY
MR. CONWAY.</h3>

<p>Mr. W. M. Conway, who was sent out by the
Royal Geographical Society of London last spring
to explore the Kara Koram Mountains and their
mighty glaciers north of Cashmere, has accomplished
the most brilliant feats of mountain and
glacier climbing that any explorer has achieved
in years. He has sent to the society a report
of his ascent of the Baltoro glacier, over forty
miles in length and the longest glacier that is
known in temperate regions, and of his ascent
of an ice-covered mountain over 23,000 feet high
at the upper end of the glacier.</p>

<p>He began the ascent of the Baltoro glacier
on Aug. 5. He had little idea on starting of the
discomforts before him. His party included
three Englishmen besides himself, an Alpine
guide, and four Sepoys detailed from an Indian
regiment. Fully two-thirds of the entire
length of the glacier was so completely covered
with stone debris that the ice was not visible except
where lakes or crevasses occurred. He was
unable to ascend along the banks at the sides
of the glacier, for they were not traversable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
He was therefore forced to go up the horrible
middle of the ice. The surface was not flat,
but was a series of prodigious mounds. He measured
one of them, which was over 200 feet high,
and it was usually easier to climb over these
mounds than to circumvent them. The stones
that rested upon the ice were constantly giving
way under foot. The consequence was that the
progress of the heavily laden Sepoys was slow
and the marches had to be short.</p>

<p>The party was nearly two weeks ascending
this icy river, four days of which time they remained
in camp on account of stormy weather.
When they finally turned up a tributary glacier
in order to ascend the mountain, they had reached
a height of 16,000 feet above the sea. All
through the journey the cold was very severe.
The party was very heavily laden because in
addition to their food supplies it was necessary
to carry a quantity of fuel.</p>

<p>It was not until Aug. 25, twenty days after
they had left the foot of the glacier, that they
began the assaults upon the icy peak which they
intended to surmount. Two or three of the
party had become disabled by cold and fatigue,
and had to return to a camp established on the
glacier. The party complained of some discomforts
which travelers among the Himalayas have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
often mentioned. The sun, day after day came
out with scorching power, and while their feet
were numbed with cold, their bodies were far
too hot to be comfortable. Mr. Conway says
the great variations between biting cold and
grilling heat are the chief impediments to mountaineering
at high altitudes in those regions.
Not only the cold and the heat alike are hard to
endure, but the change from one to the other
seems to weaken the forces and render the whole
body feeble.</p>

<p>Ascending the steep slope of the final peak,
their climbing irons were of the greatest assistance.
They found to their dismay after climbing
a few hundred feet that the upper part of
<i>the peak was not of snow, but of hard, blue
ice, covered with a thin layer of snow. Every
step they took had to be cut through the snow
into the ice. The ice was too hard for the steel
points of the climbing irons to penetrate until
it had been prepared by a stroke or two of the
ax.</i> The Alpine guide said the work of step
cutting was far more fatiguing than he had ever
experienced in Switzerland. One of the Sepoys
was overtaken by mountain sickness and had to
be left behind. Now and then a puff of air
inspired the party with a little life. Most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the time they suffered from the rarefication of the
air.</p>

<p>Reaching the top, about 23,000 feet above the
sea, Conway named the mountain Pioneer Point.
He saw the most glorious views on every side.
The whole panorama of valley, mountain, glacier,
and snow has an effect, at an elevation, of majestic
repose. The observers were far above the
noises of avalanches and rivers and nature’s
forces were reduced to mere insignificance as
they gazed thousands of feet below them upon
the scenery. Many of the mountains they saw
had not before been seen by human eye.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>ANOTHER GULF STREAM FROM SAME
SOURCE.</h3>

<p>In many respects the North Pacific ocean resembles
the North Atlantic. A great warm current,
much like the Gulf Stream, and of equal
magnitude, called the Black Stream, or Japan
current, runs northward along the eastern shore
of Asia. Close to the east coast of Japan it flows
through a marine valley which holds the deepest
water in the world. It was sounded at a depth
of 5¼ miles by the United States steamer Tuscaroa
in 1875, while surveying for a projected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
cable route between the United States and Japan.
The heavy sounding weight took more than an
hour to sink to the bottom. But trial was made
of a chasm yet more profound, where the lead
did not fetch it up at all. It is the only depth of
ocean that remains unfathomed.—<i>San Francisco
Examiner.</i></p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<p>At the head of Onion Valley, in Inyo County,
Cal., are two abrupt mountains, one 13,000 and
the other 14,000 feet high. Tumbling down the
side of one is a cataract 500 feet high, which in
the distance resembles falling snow, and two
other waterfalls of equal height are visible from
the head of the valley.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>THE LAKE ON THE MOUNTAIN.</h3>

<h4>MR. DRUMMOND THINKS HE HAS FOUND WHERE
ITS WATERS COME FROM.</h4>

<p>On the north side of Lake Ontario, southwest
of the Canadian city of Kingston, is a lake
situated on a height of land one side of which
forms a cliff. It is just south of the arm of Lake
Ontario known as Quinte Bay and it stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
180 feet above the bay. There is no opportunity
for surface waters to flow into this little lake and
no one has the slightest idea whence it derives
its waters, which are clear and fresh. The lake
is about one and a half miles long with a width
of about three-quarters of a mile.</p>

<p>Mr. A. T. Drummond recently wrote a letter
to <i>Nature</i>, in which he said he believed he had
solved the mystery of the invisible inflow, which
cannot possibly be attributed to springs from
any higher ground in the neighborhood. In his
opinion the source of the lake is to be found in
the Trenton limestone area some twenty-five or
thirty miles to the northeast. There is a steady
rise in these rocks to the north and their dip is
favorable to sending the water that sinks through
the soil to them southward to the region of Lake
Ontario. Fifty miles away the rocks have a
height of 400 feet above the lake.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the bearing of these rocks
upon the origin of the inflow, Mr. Drummond
last summer made a series of soundings in the
little lake. The largest part of the lake is shallow,
but along its southern edge he found a great
rent in the bottom nearly a mile long and a third
of a mile wide. In this rent the depths varied
from seventy-five to 100 feet. He says the rent
is probably due to a wide fault or breakage in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the Trenton limestone, and he believes that the
same forces that gave rise to this fault may account
for a subterranean connection with the
higher ground many miles to the north through
which the water finds its way into the little lake
that overlooks Ontario. Mr. Drummond’s theory
is the most plausible that has yet been suggested
to account for the source from which this
mysterious lake receives its waters.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>A BOILING LAKE.</h3>

<p>There is a lake of boiling water in the Island
of Dominica, lying in the mountains behind Roseau,
and in the valleys surrounding it are many
solfataras, or volcanic sulphur vents. In fact,
the boiling lake is little better than a crater filled
with scalding water, constantly fed by mountain
streams, and through which the pent-up gases
find vent and are ejected. The temperature of
the water on the margins of the lake ranges from
180° to 190° Fahrenheit; in the middle, exactly
over the gas vents, it is believed to be about
300°. Where this active action takes place the
water is said to rise two, three, or even four feet
above the general surface level of the lake, the
cone often dividing so that the orifices through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
which the gas escapes are legion in number. This
violent disturbance over the gas jets causes a
violent action over the whole surface of the lake,
and, though the cones appear to be special vents,
the sulphurous vapors rise with equal density
over its entire surface. Contrary to what one
would naturally suppose, there seems to be in
no case violent action of the escaping gases, such
as explosions or detonations. The water is of
dark gray color, and having been boiled over and
over for thousands of years, has become thick
and slimy with sulphur. As the inlets to the
lake are rapidly closing, it is believed that it will
soon assume the character of a geyser or sulphurous
crater.—<i>St. Louis Republic.</i></p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>AN UNCANNY LAKE.</h3>

<p>There is in Missouri a lake, perched on the
top of a mountain, its surface from 50 to 100
feet below the level of the earth surrounding it,
fed by no surface streams, untouched by the wind,
dead as the sea of Sodom. There is no point
of equal altitude from which water could flow
within hundreds of miles, and yet it has a periodical
rise of 30 feet or over, which is in
no way affected by the atmospheric conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
in the country adjacent. It may rain for weeks
in Webster County, and the return of fair weather
will find Devil’s Lake at its lowest point, while
it may reach its highest point during a protracted
drouth.—<i>St. Louis Globe-Democrat.</i></p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>CURIOUS LAKE IN THE WEST INDIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, Oct. 14.—<i>Editor of the Herald</i>:—In
your very interesting “Missing Links” of to-day
you mention the great sunken lake in the
Cascade Mountains as the most deeply sunken
lake in the world. This reminded me of a lake
similar to this which I visited while traveling
in the West Indies in 1891. This lake is situated
in the island of St. Vincent on the highest peak
of the Souffrière range of mountains, 4,500 feet
above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>It is one mile and a half down to the surface
of the water and like the Cascade Lake the depth
of the water is unknown.</p>

<p>Soundings were taken many years ago by Lieutenant
Smith, of the United States navy, but with
no result. The lake is almost a complete circle
and is about three or four miles in circumference.</p>

<p>The color of the water is light olive, but there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
are times when it changes to an intense yellow
and is saturated with sulphur. It was in the latter
state that I saw it in 1891, and so thick was
the sulphur that two of our party who ventured
to bathe came out with a thin coating of sulphur
on many parts of their body and emitting
so strong an odor that we were forced to quarantine
them for some hours.</p>

<h3>LOFTY LAKES OF THE WORLD.</h3>

<p>The most loftily situated lakes are found among
the Himalaya Mountains in Thibet. Their altitudes
do not, however, seem to have been accurately
gauged, for different authorities give
widely different figures regarding them. According
to some, Lake Manasurovara, one of the
sacred lakes of Thibet, is between 19,000 and
20,000 feet above the level of the sea, and if
this is so it is undoubtedly the loftiest lake in
the world. Two other Thibetan lakes, those of
Cholamoo and Surakol, are stated to be 17,000
and 15,400 feet in altitude respectively. For
a long time it was supposed that Lake Titicaca,
in South America, was the loftiest in the world.
It covers about 4,500 square miles, and is 924 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
above the sea. In spite of inexactitude with regard
to the measurements of the elevation of
the Thibetan lakes, they are, no doubt, considerably
higher than this and any others.—<i>New York

<h3>THE WATER STILL RISES.</h3>

<h4>QUEER PRANKS OF A LAKE AS AN EFFECT OF AN
EARTHQUAKE SHOCK.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, September 18.—To-day’s <i>Herald</i>
has these cable dispatches:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">San Salvador, via Galveston, Tex.</span>, September
12, 1891.—The waters in Llapango Cojutepeque,
or Illabasco Lake, as it is variously
known, keep on rising. The workmen sent by
the government to open an outlet to the ocean
are still hard at work.</p>

<p>“The shocks continue to be felt at irregular
intervals. The earthquake of September 8 was
experienced all over the country. The material
losses are estimated at $500,000, although
this seems a low figure.</p>

<p>“News was received here this morning from
Guatemala City that ex-vice-President Dr. Rafeel
Aola had been accidentally shot and killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
while attempting to separate two of his friends

<hr class="tiny" />
<p>In the extreme eastern edge of Arizona there
is a great shallow salt lake in a bowl-like depression,
the sink itself being some hundreds
of feet deep and three miles across. The basin,
all the portion of it not taken up by the lake,
is dazzling white with millions upon millions of
salt crystals. In the center of the lake rises
what appears to be a cone-shaped volcanic peak.
Should you take the trouble to ford the lake you
will find a miniature lake in the middle of the
peak clear as crystal.</p>

<h3>THE DEEPEST LAKE KNOWN.</h3>

<p>By far the deepest lake in the world is Lake
Baikal, in Siberia, which is in every way comparable
to the great Canadian lakes as regards size;
for, while its area of over 9,000 square miles
makes it about equal to Lake Erie in superficial
extent, its enormous depth of between 4,000
and 4,500 feet makes the volume of its waters
almost equal to that of Lake Superior.
Although its surface is 1,350 feet above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the sea level, its bottom is nearly 3,000 feet
below it. The Caspian Lake, or Sea, as it is
usually called, has a depth in its southern basin
of over 3,000 feet. Lake Maggiore is 2,800 feet
deep, Lake Como nearly 2,000 feet, and Lagodi-Garda,
another Italian lake, has a depth in certain
places of 1,900 feet. Lake Constance is over
1,000 feet deep, and Huron and Michigan reach
depths of 900 and 1,000 feet.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<p>Blowout Mountains in the cascades above
Breitenbush, Ore., is unmistakably one of the
wonders of the cascades, consisting of about
eight hundred acres of granite rock piled up in
every conceivable shape. From all indications
it has been caused by an accumulation of gas
below, which bursting out threw the rock into
the cañon, forming a beautiful lake from twenty
to thirty rods wide and half a mile long, in which
abound myriads of trout.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<p>A peculiar fish, of brown color, without scales,
and weighing twenty-one pounds, was caught
in a net at New Dorp, Staten Island, this week,
by the lighthouse keeper. In forty years’ fishing
the keeper has never seen a similar fish.</p>

<h3>A MAMMOTH SPRING.</h3>

<p>The largest and most wonderful spring of fresh
water in the world is on the gulf coast of Florida
in Hernando County. The Wekowechee River, a
stream large enough to float a small steamer, is
made entirely of water spouted from this gigantic
natural well, which is 60 feet in diameter and
about 70 or 80 feet deep. Chemists who have
analyzed the water say that there is not a trace
of organic matter in its composition, and that
it is the most pure and fresh of any spring in
America. A dime tossed into the spring can be
seen lying on the bottom as plainly as it could
in a glass of common well water. The steamer
which makes regular excursion trips up and down
the Wekowechee is often floated into the cavity
of the spring, but cannot be made to stay in the
center, as the force of the rising water forces it
to the sides of the basin. The spring and 2,000
acres of land adjoining belong to two Chicago
capitalists, who are making it a pleasure resort.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>THE WORLD’S LARGEST SPRING.</h3>

<p>At Mammoth Spring, Ark., and under the
shadow of the Ozark Mountains, is the largest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
spring in the world. The water comes up in such
a body that it forms a lake about the orifice. The
output of the spring is 29,600,000 gallons daily.
Records have been kept of it for ten years, and
during that time the output has not varied 100
gallons a day nor the temperature a single degree.
Winter and summer the spring remains at
59 degrees. The spring is evidently the outlet of
some underground river.</p>

<h3>FRESH WATER FROM A SALT BAY.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From the Florida Times-Union and Citizen.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belleair</span>, March 3.—The Eldridge spring
is quite an attraction to the visitors; it furnishes
drink water for the hotel. It is out in the bay,
but is cemented up, so as to keep out the salt
water, and throws up 100,000 gallons of water
per day.</p>

<h3>A STRANGE POND.</h3>

<p>Hicks Pond, in Palmyra, Me., is a strange
body of water. It is only twelve acres in area,
but it is more than 100 feet in depth. It has no
visible inlet, although a fair sized stream flows
from it into Lake Sebasticook. The volume of
its waters is not materially affected by either
drouth or freshet, and the water is always cold.—<i>Philadelphia
Ledger.</i></p>

<h3>WONDERS BENEATH THE SURFACE.</h3>

<p>Workmen engaged in sinking an artesian well
in Sandy Valley, near Niria, N. M., struck an
open seam, from which a cold stream of air
rushed with force enough to remove a 12-pound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
rock laid over the opening. The air was charged
with millions of small yellow bugs, each having
but two legs, no wings and a small red circle on
his back. They lived but a few seconds after
striking the warm outside air. Local scientists
are puzzling over the question: How did they get
so far down into the earth?—<i>St. Louis Republic.</i></p>

<h3>FISH IN AN OLD WELL.</h3>

<p>Some queer fish were taken out of the recently
reopened well on the United States fish station
at San Marcos, Texas, says the Louisville <i>Courier-Journal</i>.
There were several salamanders,
varying in length from an inch and a half to four
and a half inches. These creatures live on land
or water, have human-looking faces, hands and
feet, bulldog head, tail of an eel and body of fish.
There were also large numbers of shrimps, resembling
sea shrimps, only much smaller. It is
an artesian well, and everybody wants to know
where the creatures come from.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<p>A wonderful artesian well is in flourishing
activity at Huron, N. D. It throws a stream 100
feet high, and the flow is estimated at from 8,000
to 10,000 gallons a minute.</p>

<h3>ST. WINIFRED’S WELL.</h3>

<p>One of the most copious springs in Great Britain
is the famed St. Winifred’s well, near the
town of Holywell, in Flintshire. The well is an
oblong square, about twelve feet by seven, and
its water, say the people of the district, has never
been known to freeze. This latter assertion may
be true, as besides containing a fair percentage
of mineral matter that lowers its freezing point,
the well is inside a beautiful chapel, which was
erected over it by Queen Margaret, the mother
of Henry VII. The water thrown up is not less
than eighty-four hogsheads every minute, and the
quantity appears to vary very little either in
drouth or after the heaviest rain, showing doubtless
that its primitive sources are numerous and
widely distributed. Sir Winifred’s has been the
object of many pilgrimages.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3>MONTEZUMA’S WELL.</h3>

<p>One of the most pleasing natural curiosities
in the Territory of Arizona is the pool of water
known as Montezuma’s well. It is situated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
fifteen miles northeast of the old abandoned military
post known as Cape Verde. It is 25 feet in
diameter, and the clear, pure water is about sixty
feet below the surface of the surrounding country.
Some years ago certain military officers
sounded the pool and found that it had a uniform
depth of eighty feet of water, except in one place,
apparently about six feet square, where the
sounding line went down about 500 feet without
touching bottom.</p>

<p>The well empties into Beaver Creek, only about
100 yards distant, the water gushing forth from
the rocks as though it were under great pressure.
The well is undoubtedly supplied from subterranean
sources, possibly through the hole
sounded by the army officers years ago. The
sides of the well are honeycombed with caves
and tunnels, permitting sightseers to descend to
the water’s edge.</p>

<p>Montezuma’s well contains no fish. The flow
of water from it is the same throughout the season.
Popular opinion has attributed the origin
of the well to volcanic action, but as the rock
surrounding it is limestone, it is more than probable
that the action of the water is responsible for
its creation.—<i>Native American.</i></p>

<h3>A REMARKABLE ISLAND.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From the Pittsburg Dispatch.</i></p>

<p>A rim of land inclosing a fresh-water lake in
the middle of the Pacific Ocean is a novelty in
the way of islands. There may not be more than
one such in the great ocean, and, at any rate, that
type of island is extremely rare. This strange
spot is Niuafou, which is quite apart from other
ocean islands. It lies midway between the Fiji
and Samoa groups, and is under the government
of the Tonga group, though it is 200 miles from
these islands.</p>

<p>It has recently been visited by Lieutenant
Somerville, of the British Navy. Some time or
other a volcanic vent opened at the bottom of the
ocean, and the lava that poured out of it piled up
higher and higher, until it finally overtopped
the sea. A great volcanic mountain had been
formed, and the part of it that came into view
above the waste of waters was, of course, an island.
As time went on this volcano was the scene
of one of those tremendous explosions that sometimes
tear mountains to pieces. It was such a
cataclysm that blew off the upper 3,000 feet of
Krakatoa some years ago.</p>

<p>The explosion at Niuafou had a remarkable result.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
The interior of the crater was blown out
to a considerable depth, leaving only the narrow
rim, in this case a nearly perfect ring, around the
deep central cavity. Such is the island of to-day.</p>

<p>A thousand Tongans live in the five villages
that lie along the outer slope of that crater wall.
The drainage from the inner slope has partly
filled the cavity, forming a lake whose waters,
though slightly alkaline, are drinkable. From
the top of the crater rim one looks down upon the
peaceful lake within, with its three little islands
and the curiously shaped peninsula jutting out
into it; and outside the rim is the ever-restless
ocean.</p>

<h3>WHERE THE VALLEY WAS A HILL IS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From the Chicago Record.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seattle</span>, Wash., April 6.—A tremendous upheaval,
accompanied by wonderful changes, occurred
in the Mount Baker district March 27.
What had once been a valley and the bed of a
river is now a hill seventy feet high. The noise
of the upheaval was heard at Hamilton, ten miles
away. A report of the occurrence was brought
to the city by D. P. Simons, Jr.</p>

<p>Simons says the noise of the upheaval sounded
like heavy thunder. He and his party, who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
examining timber lands, journeyed in the direction
from which the sound came, and were astonished
to see a huge mound of earth, nearly a
quarter of a mile square, where formerly there
had been a valley. In places the mound was
seventy feet high. The Nooksachk River had
been turned from its course, and ran around one
side of a hill. Nearly in the center of this high
bank of earth was a large lake. A forest had
formerly occupied the ground, and trees which
had escaped destruction rose above the water.
There were cracks here and there in the mound
large enough to ingulf a horse and wagon.
There was a smell of sulphur in the air, and it is
Mr. Simons’s impression that the disturbance was
caused by gases underneath the mountain.</p>

<p>William Hadley, a trapper, whose wrecked
cabin now stands in the center of the huge
mound, was absent at the time of the upheaval,
and thus escaped death. His cabin was split in
two.</p>

<h3>REMARKABLE GEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY.</h3>

<p>According to a Florida paper a remarkable
geological discovery has been made there. The
<i>Galena Advocate</i> says: “As P. M. Oliver, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
company with a lot of friends, was chasing a
fox through his field near Payne’s prairie Saturday
night last his horse ran into a sink and in
getting the animal out Sunday morning attention
was attracted to the numerous curious petrological
formations on the sides of the sink. Further
examination Monday disclosed immense
beds of the petrified bones of the now extinct
dinotherium giganteum, icthyosaurus, glyptodon,
cuvieri, plesiosaurus, and peterodactyl. This
is probably the richest find in the world and was
altogether accidental.”</p>

<h3>TUNNELLING FOR WATER.</h3>

<h4>FOLKS OUT IN IDAHO WHO RUN THEIR WELLS INTO
A SIDE HILL.</h4>

<p>The citizens of Sweet, Canyon County, Idaho,
have a novel way of obtaining water for domestic
and irrigation purposes. The water is dug out of
the hillside, with wells run like tunnels, and not
down into the earth as ordinary wells are dug.
East of the town, there is a bluff out of which
sparkling mountain water can be procured almost
anywhere by merely running a tunnel in from
twenty to forty feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>At one point in town, a stream sufficient to irrigate
a fine orchard and garden, besides an ample
supply for domestic use and for watering all the
teams that pass that way, comes pouring out of
the 40-foot tunnel. Neither the spring freshets
nor the summer drouths affect its flow.</p>

<h3>DOMINICA’S BOILING LAKE.</h3>

<h4>A NATURAL CURIOSITY THAT WAS NOT DISCOVERED
TILL 1875.</h4>

<p>Mr. Sterns-Fadelle of Dominica has just published
a little book giving some interesting information
recently obtained about a curious natural
phenomenon in Dominica, one of the Lesser Antilles.</p>

<p>This island is only 291 square miles in area.
It was colonized by the Spaniards in the seventeenth
century and peopled later by French emigrants,
who controlled the island uninterruptedly
until the eighteenth century, and its resources
have since been exploited by English and French;
and yet its natural curiosity in the northern part
of the island had never been seen or heard of until
twenty-eight years ago.</p>

<p>This can be explained only by the fact that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
neighborhood of the boiling Lake of Dominica
is difficult of access. The lake was discovered by
an Englishman, Dr. Nichols, who organized an
expedition to explore the unknown part of the
island.</p>

<p>One day his little party were clambering up a
mountain. They suddenly came upon evidences
of sulphur, and a moment later stood looking
down into a crater which was filled with boiling
water.</p>

<p>Stifling vapors rose from the agitated surface,
rumblings of thunder came from the subterranean
regions, and near the center of the little lake,
where the water was most violently disturbed, the
furious boiling lifted the surface ten or twelve
feet above the general level. The lake was constantly
fed by several small brooks that poured
from the heights above the crater.</p>

<p>Mr. Sterns-Fadelle says that the lake is still
boiling. It has been found to be at an altitude of
2,490 meters above sea level. In form it is elliptical.</p>

<p>When it is filled with water it is about 200 feet
long and less than 100 feet wide. Its depth is
unknown. An attempt to touch bottom was made
thirty feet from the water edge, where, at a depth
of 195 feet, no bottom was reported.</p>

<p>The water is not always in movement. At certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
times the surface is calm and glistens brilliantly
under the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>At other times it is violently agitated and boils
away, exactly like a big tea kettle. But, instead
of the singing that accompanies the ebullitions in
the kettle, the boiling fluid in this cauldron is accompanied
by the gruffest and most unpleasant
detonations. Little waves roll up on the narrow
shelf of sandy beach, which is covered with a
scum of sulphur.</p>

<p>The boiling lake is the center of the present
volcanic activity of Grande Souffrière, or Diabolin,
a mountain covering an area of about five square
miles. The lake is one of the last vestiges of volcanic
energy left to the big mountain, which within
the historical period has had no great outbursts.</p>

<h3>LAKE CICOTT’S SEVEN-YEAR RISE.</h3>

<h4>INDIANA PHENOMENON REAPPEARS ON SCHEDULE
TIME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Indianapolis</span>, Aug. 1.—With neither outlet
nor inlet that is at any time visible, Lake Cicott,
a small body of water in Cass County, has now
reached a height which it attains every seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
years, and hundreds of acres of fine corn land are
covered by several feet of water. The rural mail
route, which runs along the lake’s banks, has been
abandoned by the carrier, for the water covers
it to a depth of three feet and stretches beyond
for several hundred yards.</p>

<p>Lake Cicott has been an interesting phenomenon
to the people of northern Indiana for many
years, but the secret of its rise and fall
has never been discovered. It is the only
Lake in Cass County and is about one
mile wide and about one mile long. The
water is clear and cold and perfectly fresh. Its
most mysterious characteristic is the fact that
it overflows its banks every seventh year. The
farmers who own the land upon its banks have
become so used to this that they never attempt
to cultivate the land in the seventh year, but give
it up without protest, as they know it is sure to be
claimed by the waters.</p>

<p>The Pottawattomie Indians who inhabited what
is now Cass and adjoining counties were familiar
with the characteristic of the lake. They believed
that its bottom was inhabited by a powerful spirit,
which at intervals of seven years caused the
lake to overflow. They construed this action as
approval of the tribe by the spirit, and watched
anxiously for the time to come, for they saw in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
the rising waters a sure indication that they had
done nothing to displease it. The early white settlers
became acquainted with the legend and the
oldest inhabitant is not able to recall a time that
the overflow did not take place when expected.</p>

<p>The water has now reached its highest point,
and will soon begin to recede and continue to do
so till the old confines are reached. Residents
of the locality say that the weather conditions
have no effect upon the lake, for its rise in the
seventh year takes place regardless of the fact
of rain or drouth. Amos Jordan, a veteran of
the civil war, who lives on a bluff overlooking the
lake, says the only apparent difference between
wet and dry seasons when the rise occurs is that
the water appears to be colder in time of drouth.
What is true of the rise of the waters is also
true of their recession, for they gradually disappear
regardless of the amount of rainfall in the
county.</p>

<p>The phenomenon is explained on the theory
that there is a subterranean outlet, which becomes
closed in some way and is opened by the
pressure of the water when the highest point is
reached every seventh year; but this is mere
guesswork and nothing has ever been discovered
to justify such a theory. The Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Railroad Company, which owns a number of ice-houses
on the edge of the lake, made soundings
at different places before the rise began, and
found the greatest depth to be ninety feet.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Hundreds more of such clippings have been
preserved in a scrap book describing similar
phenomena all over the Earth, all of which seem
solvable through claims herein set forth, in the
combined influences of frictional and volcanic
heat, and the occasional contact with outpouring
streams from the <i>internal</i> ocean of fresh
water.</p>
